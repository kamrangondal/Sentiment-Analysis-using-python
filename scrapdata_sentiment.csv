</p>, <p>According to <i>Article 1.3</i> of the <a href=""/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations"" title=""ITU Radio Regulations"">Radio Regulations</a> (RR), telecommunication is defined as <i>« Any <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)"" title=""Transmission (telecommunications)"">transmission</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Emission_(radiocommunications)"" title=""Emission (radiocommunications)"">emission</a> or reception of signs, signals, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by <a href=""/wiki/Wire"" title=""Wire"">wire</a>, radio, optical, or other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Electromagnetic"" title=""Electromagnetic"">electromagnetic</a> systems</i>.» This definition is identical to those contained in the Annex to the <a href=""/wiki/Constitution_and_Convention_of_the_International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union"">Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union</a> (Geneva, 1992).
</p>, <p>The early telecommunication networks were created with copper wires as the physical medium for signal transmission. For many years, these networks were used for basic phone services, namely voice and telegrams. Since the mid-1990s, as the internet has grown in popularity, voice has been gradually supplanted by data. This soon demonstrated the limitations of copper in data transmission, prompting the development of optics.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:11_3-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:11-3"">[3]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The word <i>telecommunication</i> is a compound of the Greek prefix <i>tele</i> (τῆλε), meaning <i>distant</i>, <i>far off</i>, or <i>afar</i>,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup> and the Latin <i>communicare</i>, meaning <i>to share</i>. Its modern use is adapted from the French,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-oxford_7-0""><a href=""#cite_note-oxford-7"">[7]</a></sup> because its written use was recorded in 1904 by the French engineer and novelist <a href=""/wiki/%C3%89douard_Estauni%C3%A9"" title=""Édouard Estaunié"">Édouard Estaunié</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> <i>Communication</i> was first used as an English word in the late 14th century. It comes from Old French comunicacion (14c., Modern French communication), from Latin communicationem (nominative communicatio), noun of action from past participle stem of communicare ""to share, divide out; communicate, impart, inform; join, unite, participate in"", literally ""to make common"", from communis"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-10""><a href=""#cite_note-10"">[10]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Homing_pigeon"" title=""Homing pigeon"">Homing pigeons</a> have occasionally been used throughout history by different cultures. <a href=""/wiki/Pigeon_post"" title=""Pigeon post"">Pigeon post</a> had <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Persia"" title=""Persia"">Persian</a> roots, and was later used by the Romans to aid their military. <a href=""/wiki/Frontinus"" title=""Frontinus"">Frontinus</a> said that <a href=""/wiki/Julius_Caesar"" title=""Julius Caesar"">Julius Caesar</a> used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of <a href=""/wiki/Gaul"" title=""Gaul"">Gaul</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Levi_11-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Levi-11"">[11]</a></sup>
The <a href=""/wiki/Greeks"" title=""Greeks"">Greeks</a> also conveyed the names of the victors at the <a href=""/wiki/Ancient_Olympic_Games"" title=""Ancient Olympic Games"">Olympic Games</a> to various cities using homing pigeons.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-12""><a href=""#cite_note-12"">[12]</a></sup> In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Java_(island)"" title=""Java (island)"">Java</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Sumatra"" title=""Sumatra"">Sumatra</a>. And in 1849, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Paul_Julius_Reuter"" title=""Paul Julius Reuter"">Paul Julius Reuter</a> started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between <a href=""/wiki/Aachen"" title=""Aachen"">Aachen</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Brussels"" title=""Brussels"">Brussels</a>, a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In the Middle Ages, chains of <a href=""/wiki/Beacon"" title=""Beacon"">beacons</a> were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as ""the enemy has been sighted"" had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable instance of their use was during the <a href=""/wiki/Spanish_Armada"" title=""Spanish Armada"">Spanish Armada</a>, when a beacon chain relayed a signal from <a href=""/wiki/Plymouth"" title=""Plymouth"">Plymouth</a> to <a href=""/wiki/London"" title=""London"">London</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In 1792, <a href=""/wiki/Claude_Chappe"" title=""Claude Chappe"">Claude Chappe</a>, a French engineer, built the first fixed visual <a href=""/wiki/Telegraphy"" title=""Telegraphy"">telegraphy</a> system (or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Semaphore_line"" title=""Semaphore line"">semaphore line</a>) between <a href=""/wiki/Lille"" title=""Lille"">Lille</a> and Paris.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup> However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>On 25 July 1837 the first commercial <a href=""/wiki/Electrical_telegraph"" title=""Electrical telegraph"">electrical telegraph</a> was demonstrated by English inventor Sir <a href=""/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke"" title=""William Fothergill Cooke"">William Fothergill Cooke</a>, and English scientist Sir <a href=""/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone"" title=""Charles Wheatstone"">Charles Wheatstone</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-17""><a href=""#cite_note-17"">[17]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup> Both inventors viewed their device as ""an improvement to the [existing] electromagnetic telegraph"" not as a new device.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-19""><a href=""#cite_note-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Samuel_Morse"" title=""Samuel Morse"">Samuel Morse</a> independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. <a href=""/wiki/Morse_code"" title=""Morse code"">His code</a> was an important advance over Wheatstone's signaling method.

</p>, <p>The conventional telephone was patented by <a href=""/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell"" title=""Alexander Graham Bell"">Alexander Bell</a> in 1876. <a href=""/wiki/Elisha_Gray"" title=""Elisha Gray"">Elisha Gray</a> also filed a caveat for it in 1876. Gray abandoned his caveat and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on 3 March 1876.

</p>, <p>Starting in 1894, Italian inventor <a href=""/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi"" title=""Guglielmo Marconi"">Guglielmo Marconi</a> began developing a wireless communication using the then newly discovered phenomenon of <a href=""/wiki/Radio_wave"" title=""Radio wave"">radio waves</a>, showing by 1901 that they could be transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-25""><a href=""#cite_note-25"">[25]</a></sup> This was the start of <a href=""/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy"" title=""Wireless telegraphy"">wireless telegraphy</a> by radio. On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in <a href=""/wiki/Glace_Bay"" title=""Glace Bay"">Glace Bay</a>, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America and in 1904 a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-26""><a href=""#cite_note-26"">[26]</a></sup>

</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/World_War_I"" title=""World War I"">World War I</a> accelerated the development of radio for <a href=""/wiki/Military_communications"" title=""Military communications"">military communications</a>. After the war, commercial radio <a href=""/wiki/AM_broadcasting"" title=""AM broadcasting"">AM broadcasting</a> began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. <a href=""/wiki/World_War_II"" title=""World War II"">World War II</a> again accelerated the development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation and radar.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-31""><a href=""#cite_note-31"">[31]</a></sup> Development of stereo <a href=""/wiki/FM_broadcasting"" title=""FM broadcasting"">FM broadcasting</a> of radio took place from the 1930s on-wards in the United States and displaced AM as the dominant commercial standard by the 1960s, and by the 1970s in the United Kingdom.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-32""><a href=""#cite_note-32"">[32]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>On 25 March 1925, <a href=""/wiki/John_Logie_Baird"" title=""John Logie Baird"">John Logie Baird</a> was able to demonstrate the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store <a href=""/wiki/Selfridges"" title=""Selfridges"">Selfridges</a>.

</p>, <p>The type of device known as a <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Thermionic_tube"" title=""Thermionic tube"">thermionic tube</a></i> or <i>thermionic valve</i> uses the phenomenon of <a href=""/wiki/Thermionic_emission"" title=""Thermionic emission"">thermionic emission</a> of electrons from a heated <a href=""/wiki/Hot_cathode"" title=""Hot cathode"">cathode</a> and is used for a number of fundamental electronic functions such as signal <a href=""/wiki/Amplifier"" title=""Amplifier"">amplification</a> and current <a href=""/wiki/Rectifier"" title=""Rectifier"">rectification</a>.
</p>, <p>Non-thermionic types, such as a vacuum <a href=""/wiki/Phototube"" title=""Phototube"">phototube</a> however, achieve electron emission through the <a href=""/wiki/Photoelectric_effect"" title=""Photoelectric effect"">photoelectric effect</a>, and are used for such as the detection of light levels. In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the <a href=""/wiki/Anode"" title=""Anode"">anode</a> by the <a href=""/wiki/Electric_field"" title=""Electric field"">electric field</a> in the tube.

</p>, <p>Modern telecommunication is founded on a series of key concepts that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication technologies may primarily be divided into wired and wireless methods. Overall though, a basic <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communication_system"" title=""Communication system"">telecommunication system</a> consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:
</p>, <p>For example, in a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Radio_station"" title=""Radio station"">radio broadcasting station</a> the station's large <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Power_amplifier"" title=""Power amplifier"">power amplifier</a> is the transmitter; and the broadcasting <a href=""/wiki/Antenna_(radio)"" title=""Antenna (radio)"">antenna</a> is the interface between the power amplifier and the ""free space channel"". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the <a href=""/wiki/Radio_receiver"" title=""Radio receiver"">radio receiver</a> is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.
</p>, <p>Sometimes, telecommunication systems are <a href=""/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)"" title=""Duplex (telecommunications)"">""duplex""</a> (two-way systems) with a single box of <a href=""/wiki/Electronics"" title=""Electronics"">electronics</a> working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a <i>transceiver</i>. For example, a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cellular_telephone"" title=""Cellular telephone"">cellular telephone</a> is a transceiver.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-0""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup> The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in watts or kilowatts, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Microwatt"" title=""Microwatt"">microwatts</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Nanowatt"" title=""Nanowatt"">nanowatts</a>. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication over fixed lines is called <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Point-to-point_communication"" title=""Point-to-point communication"">point-to-point communication</a> because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called <a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting"" title=""Broadcasting"">broadcast communication</a> because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-1""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called <a href=""/wiki/Multiplexing"" title=""Multiplexing"">multiplex systems</a>. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.
</p>, <p>Communications signals can be sent either by <a href=""/wiki/Analog_signal"" title=""Analog signal"">analog signals</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Digital_signal_(electronics)"" title=""Digital signal (electronics)"">digital signals</a>. There are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Analog_communication"" title=""Analog communication"">analog communication</a> systems and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Digital_communication"" title=""Digital communication"">digital communication</a> systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by <a href=""/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)"" title=""Noise (signal processing)"">undesirable physical noise</a>. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Random_process"" title=""Random process"">random way</a>. This form of noise is called <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Additive_noise"" title=""Additive noise"">additive noise</a>, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.
</p>, <p>On the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-77""><a href=""#cite_note-77"">[77]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The term ""channel"" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the <a href=""/wiki/Atmosphere"" title=""Atmosphere"">atmosphere</a> for sound communications, glass <a href=""/wiki/Optical_fiber"" title=""Optical fiber"">optical fibers</a> for some kinds of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Optical_communications"" title=""Optical communications"">optical communications</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Coaxial_cable"" title=""Coaxial cable"">coaxial cables</a> for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and <a href=""/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication"" title=""Free-space optical communication"">free space</a> for communications using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Visible_light"" title=""Visible light"">visible light</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Infrared"" title=""Infrared"">infrared</a> waves, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ultraviolet_light"" title=""Ultraviolet light"">ultraviolet light</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Radio_wave"" title=""Radio wave"">radio waves</a>. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or ""radio guide"", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-78""><a href=""#cite_note-78"">[78]</a></sup> This last channel is called the ""free space channel"". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect <a href=""/wiki/Vacuum"" title=""Vacuum"">vacuum</a> just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.
</p>, <p>The other meaning of the term ""channel"" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Channel_(communications)"" title=""Channel (communications)"">communications channel</a>, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/MHz"" title=""MHz"">MHz</a> (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1 MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency <a href=""/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" title=""Bandwidth (signal processing)"">bandwidth</a> of about 180 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/KHz"" title=""KHz"">kHz</a> (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the <a href=""/wiki/Carrier_wave"" title=""Carrier wave"">""carrier frequencies""</a>. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200 kHz, and the difference between 200 kHz and 180 kHz (20 kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.
</p>, <p>In the example above, the ""free space channel"" has been divided into communications channels according to <a href=""/wiki/Frequency"" title=""Frequency"">frequencies</a>, and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called ""<a href=""/wiki/Frequency-division_multiplexing"" title=""Frequency-division multiplexing"">frequency-division multiplexing</a>"".  Another term for the same concept is ""<a href=""/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing"" title=""Wavelength-division multiplexing"">wavelength-division multiplexing</a>"", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.
</p>, <p>Another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a ""time slot"", for example, 20 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Milliseconds"" title=""Milliseconds"">milliseconds</a> out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called ""<a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a>"" (<b>TDM</b>), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.
</p>, <p>The shaping of a signal to convey information is known as <a href=""/wiki/Modulation"" title=""Modulation"">modulation</a>. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called <a href=""/wiki/Keying_(telecommunications)"" title=""Keying (telecommunications)"">""keying""</a>—a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications—and several keying techniques exist (these include <a href=""/wiki/Phase-shift_keying"" title=""Phase-shift keying"">phase-shift keying</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"" title=""Frequency-shift keying"">frequency-shift keying</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying"" title=""Amplitude-shift keying"">amplitude-shift keying</a>). The ""<a href=""/wiki/Bluetooth"" title=""Bluetooth"">Bluetooth</a>"" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-79""><a href=""#cite_note-79"">[79]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-80""><a href=""#cite_note-80"">[80]</a></sup> In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) ""<a href=""/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation"" title=""Quadrature amplitude modulation"">quadrature amplitude modulation</a>"" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.
</p>, <p>Modulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the ""<a href=""/wiki/Carrier_wave"" title=""Carrier wave"">carrier wave</a>"") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being <a href=""/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"" title=""Amplitude modulation"">amplitude modulation</a> (AM) and <a href=""/wiki/Frequency_modulation"" title=""Frequency modulation"">frequency modulation</a> (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96 MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel ""96 FM"").<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-81""><a href=""#cite_note-81"">[81]</a></sup> In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).
</p>, <p>A <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_network"" title=""Telecommunications network"">telecommunications network</a> is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communications_channel"" title=""Communications channel"">communications channels</a> that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more <a href=""/wiki/Router_(computing)"" title=""Router (computing)"">routers</a> that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telephone_switch"" title=""Telephone switch"">switches</a> that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of networks, <a href=""/wiki/Repeater"" title=""Repeater"">repeaters</a> may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat <a href=""/wiki/Attenuation"" title=""Attenuation"">attenuation</a> that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-glossary_82-0""><a href=""#cite_note-glossary-82"">[82]</a></sup>
Another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecommunication_industry"" title=""Telecommunication industry"">telecommunication industry</a>'s revenue at US$4.7 trillion or just under three percent of the <a href=""/wiki/Gross_world_product"" title=""Gross world product"">gross world product</a> (official exchange rate).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-plunkettresearch01_74-2""><a href=""#cite_note-plunkettresearch01-74"">[74]</a></sup> Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.
</p>, <p>On the <a href=""/wiki/Microeconomics"" title=""Microeconomics"">microeconomic</a> scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Amazon.com"" title=""Amazon.com"">Amazon.com</a> but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer <a href=""/wiki/Walmart"" title=""Walmart"">Walmart</a> has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-83""><a href=""#cite_note-83"">[83]</a></sup> In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In <a href=""/wiki/Bangladesh"" title=""Bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a>'s <a href=""/wiki/Narsingdi_District"" title=""Narsingdi District"">Narsingdi District</a>, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In <a href=""/wiki/Ivory_Coast"" title=""Ivory Coast"">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-84""><a href=""#cite_note-84"">[84]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>On the <a href=""/wiki/Macroeconomics"" title=""Macroeconomics"">macroeconomic</a> scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and <a href=""/wiki/Leonard_Waverman"" title=""Leonard Waverman"">Leonard Waverman</a> suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-85""><a href=""#cite_note-85"">[85]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-86""><a href=""#cite_note-86"">[86]</a></sup> Few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-87""><a href=""#cite_note-87"">[87]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as the <a href=""/wiki/Digital_divide"" title=""Digital divide"">digital divide</a>. A 2003 survey by the <a href=""/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""International Telecommunication Union"">International Telecommunication Union</a> (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-88""><a href=""#cite_note-88"">[88]</a></sup> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and <a href=""/wiki/Iceland"" title=""Iceland"">Iceland</a> received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-89""><a href=""#cite_note-89"">[89]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-fischer_90-0""><a href=""#cite_note-fischer-90"">[90]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Social_networking_site"" title=""Social networking site"">social networking sites</a> has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to <a href=""/wiki/Courtship"" title=""Courtship"">courtship</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-91""><a href=""#cite_note-91"">[91]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Prior to social networking sites, technologies like <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Short_message_service"" title=""Short message service"">short message service</a> (SMS) and the telephone also had a significant impact on social interactions. In 2000, market research group <a href=""/wiki/Ipsos_MORI"" title=""Ipsos MORI"">Ipsos MORI</a> reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-92""><a href=""#cite_note-92"">[92]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before in their own home without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has also transformed the way people receive their news. A 2006 survey (right table) of slightly more than 3,000 Americans by the non-profit Pew Internet and American Life Project in the United States the majority specified television or radio over newspapers.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has had an equally significant impact on advertising. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TNS_Media_Intelligence"" title=""TNS Media Intelligence"">TNS Media Intelligence</a> reported that in 2007, 58% of advertising expenditure in the United States was spent on media that depend upon telecommunication.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-94""><a href=""#cite_note-94"">[94]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Many countries have enacted legislation which conforms to the <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=International_Telecommunication_Regulations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""International Telecommunication Regulations (page does not exist)"">International Telecommunication Regulations</a> established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is the ""leading UN agency for information and communication technology issues"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-95""><a href=""#cite_note-95"">[95]</a></sup> In 1947, at the Atlantic City Conference, the ITU decided to ""afford international protection to all frequencies registered in a new international frequency list and used in conformity with the Radio Regulation"". According to the ITU's <i>Radio Regulations</i> adopted in Atlantic City, all frequencies referenced in the <i>International Frequency Registration Board</i>, examined by the board and registered on the <i>International Frequency List</i> ""shall have the right to international protection from harmful interference"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-96""><a href=""#cite_note-96"">[96]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>From a global perspective, there have been political debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The <a href=""/wiki/History_of_broadcasting"" title=""History of broadcasting"">history of broadcasting</a> discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup> The onset of <a href=""/wiki/World_War_II"" title=""World War II"">World War II</a> brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup> Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Garfield_98-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Garfield-98"">[98]</a></sup> Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s.

</p>, <p>Modern insurgents, such as those in the latest <a href=""/wiki/Iraq_War"" title=""Iraq War"">Iraq War</a>, often use intimidating telephone calls, SMSs and the distribution of sophisticated videos of an attack on coalition troops within hours of the operation. ""The Sunni insurgents even have their own television station, <a href=""/wiki/Al-Zawraa_TV"" title=""Al-Zawraa TV"">Al-Zawraa</a>, which while banned by the Iraqi government, still broadcasts from <a href=""/wiki/Erbil"" title=""Erbil"">Erbil</a>, Iraqi Kurdistan, even as coalition pressure has forced it to switch satellite hosts several times.""<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Garfield_98-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Garfield-98"">[98]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>According to data collected by Gartner<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-101""><a href=""#cite_note-101"">[101]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-102""><a href=""#cite_note-102"">[102]</a></sup> and Ars Technica<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-103""><a href=""#cite_note-103"">[103]</a></sup> sales of main consumer's telecommunication equipment worldwide in millions of units was:
</p>, <p>In a telephone network, the caller is connected to the person to whom they wish to talk by switches at various <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telephone_exchanges"" title=""Telephone exchanges"">telephone exchanges</a>. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller <a href=""/wiki/Pulse_dialing"" title=""Pulse dialing"">dials</a> the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small <a href=""/wiki/Microphone"" title=""Microphone"">microphone</a> in the caller's <a href=""/wiki/Handset"" title=""Handset"">handset</a>. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small <a href=""/wiki/Loudspeaker"" title=""Loudspeaker"">speaker</a> in that person's handset.
</p>, <p>As of 2015, the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-104""><a href=""#cite_note-104"">[104]</a></sup> Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long-distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).
</p>, <p>Mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-105""><a href=""#cite_note-105"">[105]</a></sup> In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-106""><a href=""#cite_note-106"">[106]</a></sup> Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as <a href=""/wiki/GSM"" title=""GSM"">GSM</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/W-CDMA"" title=""W-CDMA"">W-CDMA</a> with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as <a href=""/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System"" title=""Advanced Mobile Phone System"">AMPS</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-107""><a href=""#cite_note-107"">[107]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of <a href=""/wiki/TAT-8"" title=""TAT-8"">TAT-8</a> in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optical fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optical fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-108""><a href=""#cite_note-108"">[108]</a></sup> This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optical fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics)"" title=""Crosstalk (electronics)"">crosstalk</a> which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-109""><a href=""#cite_note-109"">[109]</a></sup> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-110""><a href=""#cite_note-110"">[110]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-111""><a href=""#cite_note-111"">[111]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Assisting communication across many modern optical fibre networks is a protocol known as <a href=""/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode"" title=""Asynchronous Transfer Mode"">Asynchronous Transfer Mode</a> (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Data_transmission"" title=""Data transmission"">data transmission</a> mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a <a href=""/wiki/Traffic_contract"" title=""Traffic contract"">traffic contract</a> with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-112""><a href=""#cite_note-112"">[112]</a></sup> There are competitors to ATM, such as <a href=""/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching"" title=""Multiprotocol Label Switching"">Multiprotocol Label Switching</a> (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-113""><a href=""#cite_note-113"">[113]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-114""><a href=""#cite_note-114"">[114]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In a broadcast system, the central high-powered <a href=""/wiki/Radio_masts_and_towers"" title=""Radio masts and towers"">broadcast tower</a> transmits a high-frequency <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave"" title=""Electromagnetic wave"">electromagnetic wave</a> to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then <a href=""/wiki/Antenna_tuner"" title=""Antenna tuner"">tuned</a> so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Demodulator"" title=""Demodulator"">demodulator</a> is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-2""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-115""><a href=""#cite_note-115"">[115]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadcast_media_industry"" title=""Broadcast media industry"">broadcast media industry</a> is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable <a href=""/wiki/Integrated_circuit"" title=""Integrated circuit"">integrated circuits</a>. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as <a href=""/wiki/Noise_(video)"" title=""Noise (video)"">snowy pictures</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Television_interference_(ghosting)"" title=""Television interference (ghosting)"">ghosting</a> and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011— a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forward_error_correction"" title=""Forward error correction"">forward error correction</a> a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-116""><a href=""#cite_note-116"">[116]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-117""><a href=""#cite_note-117"">[117]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ATSC_Standards"" title=""ATSC Standards"">ATSC</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Digital_Video_Broadcasting"" title=""Digital Video Broadcasting"">DVB</a> and <a href=""/wiki/ISDB"" title=""ISDB"">ISDB</a> standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use <a href=""/wiki/MPEG-2"" title=""MPEG-2"">MPEG-2</a> for video compression. ATSC uses <a href=""/wiki/Dolby_Digital"" title=""Dolby Digital"">Dolby Digital</a> AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses <a href=""/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding"" title=""Advanced Audio Coding"">Advanced Audio Coding</a> (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses <a href=""/wiki/MPEG-1"" title=""MPEG-1"">MPEG-1</a> Part 3 Layer 2.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-118""><a href=""#cite_note-118"">[118]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-119""><a href=""#cite_note-119"">[119]</a></sup> The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the <a href=""/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting"" title=""Digital Audio Broadcasting"">Digital Audio Broadcasting</a> standard (also known as the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Eureka_147"" title=""Eureka 147"">Eureka 147</a> standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt <a href=""/wiki/HD_Radio"" title=""HD Radio"">HD Radio</a>. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as <a href=""/wiki/In-band_on-channel"" title=""In-band on-channel"">in-band on-channel</a> transmission that allows digital information to ""piggyback"" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-120""><a href=""#cite_note-120"">[120]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>However, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-121""><a href=""#cite_note-121"">[121]</a></sup> after twice delaying the switchover deadline. Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there were three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption <a href=""/wiki/File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png"" title=""File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png"">here</a>). These are known as <a href=""/wiki/PAL"" title=""PAL"">PAL</a> (German designed), <a href=""/wiki/NTSC"" title=""NTSC"">NTSC</a> (American designed), and <a href=""/wiki/SECAM"" title=""SECAM"">SECAM</a> (French-designed). For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the higher cost of digital receivers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-122""><a href=""#cite_note-122"">[122]</a></sup> The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (<b>AM</b>) or frequency modulation (<b>FM</b>). To achieve <a href=""/wiki/Stereophonic_sound"" title=""Stereophonic sound"">stereo playback</a>, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Stereo_FM"" title=""Stereo FM"">stereo FM</a>, and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or <a href=""/wiki/C-QUAM"" title=""C-QUAM"">C-QUAM</a>.
</p>, <p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_Protocol"" title=""Internet Protocol"">Internet Protocol</a> (IP).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-123""><a href=""#cite_note-123"">[123]</a></sup> Any computer on the Internet has a unique <a href=""/wiki/IP_address"" title=""IP address"">IP address</a> that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-124""><a href=""#cite_note-124"">[124]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>It is estimated that 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Landline_telephone"" title=""Landline telephone"">landline telephone</a>). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Mobile_phones"" title=""Mobile phones"">mobile phones</a>).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-HilbertLopez2011_72-1""><a href=""#cite_note-HilbertLopez2011-72"">[72]</a></sup> As of 2008<sup class=""plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update"" style=""display:none;""><a class=""external text"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Telecommunications&amp;action=edit"">[update]</a></sup>, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-125""><a href=""#cite_note-125"">[125]</a></sup> In terms of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access"" title=""Broadband Internet access"">broadband access</a>, Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-126""><a href=""#cite_note-126"">[126]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The Internet works in part because of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communications_protocol"" title=""Communications protocol"">protocols</a> that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Internet_browser"" title=""Internet browser"">Internet browser</a> to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or <a href=""/wiki/Wi-Fi"" title=""Wi-Fi"">Wi-Fi</a> connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-127""><a href=""#cite_note-127"">[127]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>For the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.
</p>, <p>At the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for <a href=""/wiki/Logical_address"" title=""Logical address"">logical addressing</a>. For the World Wide Web, these ""IP addresses"" are derived from the human-readable form using the <a href=""/wiki/Domain_Name_System"" title=""Domain Name System"">Domain Name System</a> (e.g. 72.14.207.99 is derived from www.google.com). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-128""><a href=""#cite_note-128"">[128]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>At the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the <a href=""/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"" title=""User Datagram Protocol"">User Datagram Protocol</a> (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered nor retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TCP_and_UDP_port"" title=""TCP and UDP port"">port numbers</a> with them to specify what application or <a href=""/wiki/Process_(computing)"" title=""Process (computing)"">process</a> the packet should be handled by.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-129""><a href=""#cite_note-129"">[129]</a></sup> Because certain application-level protocols use <a href=""/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"" title=""List of TCP and UDP port numbers"">certain ports</a>, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning <a href=""/wiki/WAN_optimization"" title=""WAN optimization"">priority</a>.
</p>, <p>Above the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer"" title=""Secure Sockets Layer"">Secure Sockets Layer</a> (SSL) and <a href=""/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"" title=""Transport Layer Security"">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-130""><a href=""#cite_note-130"">[130]</a></sup> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HTTP"" title=""HTTP"">HTTP</a> (web browsing), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/POP3"" title=""POP3"">POP3</a> (e-mail), <a href=""/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol"" title=""File Transfer Protocol"">FTP</a> (file transfer), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/IRC"" title=""IRC"">IRC</a> (Internet chat), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)"" title=""BitTorrent (protocol)"">BitTorrent</a> (file sharing) and <a href=""/wiki/XMPP"" title=""XMPP"">XMPP</a> (instant messaging).
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/VoIP"" title=""VoIP"">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Synchronous"" title=""Synchronous"">synchronous</a> voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate-style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-131""><a href=""#cite_note-131"">[131]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Despite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of <a href=""/wiki/Local_area_network"" title=""Local area network"">local area networks</a> (LANs)—computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Wide_area_network"" title=""Wide area network"">Wide area networks</a> (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.
</p>, <p>In the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/OSI_reference_model"" title=""OSI reference model"">OSI reference model</a>. These included <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Appletalk"" title=""Appletalk"">Appletalk</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/IPX"" title=""IPX"">IPX</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/NetBIOS"" title=""NetBIOS"">NetBIOS</a> with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with <a href=""/wiki/MS-DOS"" title=""MS-DOS"">MS-DOS</a> users. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TCP/IP"" title=""TCP/IP"">TCP/IP</a> existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-132""><a href=""#cite_note-132"">[132]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>As the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/DHCP"" title=""DHCP"">DHCP</a>, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-133""><a href=""#cite_note-133"">[133]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as <a href=""/wiki/Quality_of_service"" title=""Quality of service"">quality of service</a> guarantees, and offer <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection"" title=""Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection"">collision prevention</a>. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-134""><a href=""#cite_note-134"">[134]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Despite the modest popularity of Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">copper twisted-pair cables</a> (including the common <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/10BASE-T"" title=""10BASE-T"">10BASE-T</a> networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-135""><a href=""#cite_note-135"">[135]</a></sup> When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. <a href=""/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber"" title=""Multi-mode optical fiber"">Multimode fibers</a> can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffer from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation—implying poorer long-distance performance.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-136""><a href=""#cite_note-136"">[136]</a></sup>

Its development level is high, with close accessibility to the infrastructure from nearly all inhabited parts of the island and for all of the population, with exceptions. Today, the country is considered an international telecommunications hub, an achievement that was driven by Singapore's view that high-quality telecommunications is one of the critical factors that support its economic growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>After reform initiatives, the Singaporean telecommunication industry became streamlined and largely directed by the government, which viewed such policy as critical in shaping societal preferences and in directing the state's economy.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup> Being able to provide adequate telecommunications services is also critical when approached from the perspective that Singapore's legitimacy as a state rests on its capability to deliver a high standard of living to its citizens. Hence, beginning in the 1970s, the state pursued a three-phase strategy oriented towards developing world-class telecommunications infrastructure capable of high-quality telecommunications services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The first phase involved the expansion of infrastructure to meet business and societal needs (e.g. service enhancement, reduction of waiting lists for telephone connections). The second phase involved the integration of telecommunications to the over-all state strategy, particularly in the area of services for banking, financial services, and tourism with the goal of tapping telecommunications in ensuring the competitive advantage for Singapore.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup> The National Computer Board was formed during this period for the purpose of developing and adopting IT applications. In 1986, this agency issued Singapore's comprehensive National Information Technology Plan (NITP).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:2_3-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:2-3"">[3]</a></sup> By the late 1980s, the third phase commenced and it focused on bolstering Singapore's international role as well as the IT 2000, which was an ambitious plan to encourage new multimedia services, which is articulated in the promotion of Singapore as ""an intelligent island"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-2""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup>

The Act, signed by President <a href=""/wiki/Bill_Clinton"" title=""Bill Clinton"">Bill Clinton</a>, represented a major change in American telecommunication law, since it was the first time that the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_in_the_United_States"" title=""Internet in the United States"">Internet</a> was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-fcc.gov_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-fcc.gov-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>According to the <a href=""/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission"" title=""Federal Communications Commission"">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), the goal of the law was to ""let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business <a href=""/wiki/Competition_(economics)"" title=""Competition (economics)"">compete</a> in any market against any other.""<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup> The legislation's primary goal was <a href=""/wiki/Deregulation"" title=""Deregulation"">deregulation</a> of the converging <a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting_in_the_United_States"" title=""Broadcasting in the United States"">broadcasting</a> and telecommunications markets.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> However, the law's regulatory policies have been questioned, including the effects of dualistic re-regulation of the communications market.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Previously, the <a href=""/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934"" title=""Communications Act of 1934"">Communications Act of 1934</a> (""1934 Act"") was the statutory framework for U.S. communications policy, covering telecommunications and broadcasting.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_6-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-6"">[6]</a></sup> The 1934 Act created the FCC,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_6-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-6"">[6]</a></sup> the agency formed to implement and administer the economic regulation of the interstate activities of the telephone monopolies and the licensing of spectrum used for broadcast and other purposes. The Act left most regulation of intrastate telephone services to the states.
</p>, <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, a combination of technological change, court decisions, and changes in U.S. policy permitted competitive entry into some telecommunications and broadcast markets. In this context, the 1996 Telecommunications Act was designed to allow fewer, but larger corporations, to operate more media enterprises within a sector (such as Clear Channel's dominance in radio), and to expand across media sectors (through relaxation of cross-ownership rules), thus enabling massive and historic consolidation of media in the United States.  These changes amounted to a near-total rollback of New Deal market regulation.
</p>, <p>The 1996 Act's stated objective was to open up markets to competition by removing regulatory barriers to entry: The conference report refers to the bill ""to provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The Act was approved by the <a href=""/wiki/104th_United_States_Congress"" title=""104th United States Congress"">104th Congress</a> on January 3, 1996, and was signed into law on February 8, 1996, by President <a href=""/wiki/Bill_Clinton"" title=""Bill Clinton"">Bill Clinton</a>. It was the first bill signed at the <a href=""/wiki/Library_of_Congress"" title=""Library of Congress"">Library of Congress</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>A purpose of the 1996 Act was to foster competition among companies that use similar underlying network technologies (e.g., <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuit-switched"" title=""Circuit-switched"">circuit-switched</a> telephone networks) to provide a single type of service (e.g., voice). For example, it creates separate regulatory regimes for carriers providing voice telephone service and providers of <a href=""/wiki/Cable_television"" title=""Cable television"">cable television</a>, and a third for information services.
</p>, <p><b>Preemption.</b> One key provision allowed the FCC to preempt state or local legal requirements that acted as a barrier to entry in the provision of interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Interconnectedness.</b> Since communications services exhibit <a href=""/wiki/Network_effect"" title=""Network effect"">network effects</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Positive_externalities"" title=""Positive externalities"">positive externalities</a>, new entrants would face <a href=""/wiki/Barriers_to_entry"" title=""Barriers to entry"">barriers to entry</a> if they could not interconnect their networks with those of the incumbent carriers.  Thus, another key provision of the 1996 Act sets obligations for incumbent carriers and new entrants to interconnect their networks with one another, imposing additional requirements on the incumbents because they might desire to restrict competitive entry by denying such interconnection or by setting terms, conditions, and rates that could undermine the ability of the new entrants to compete.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-10""><a href=""#cite_note-10"">[10]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Intercarrier compensation.</b> Under these conditions, many calls will arise between parties on different networks. While it might be possible to have the calling party pay its carrier and the called party pay its carrier, for various reasons it has been traditional in the United States for the calling party's carrier to pay the called party's carrier for completing the call — this is called intercarrier compensation—and, in turn, recover those costs in the rates charged to its subscribers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11"">[11]</a></sup> The 1996 Act requires that intercarrier compensation rates among competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) be based on the ""additional costs of terminating such calls"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-12""><a href=""#cite_note-12"">[12]</a></sup> However, the framework created by the 1996 Act set different intercarrier compensation rates for services that were not competing at that time but do compete today.
</p>, <p><b>RBOCs may enter long distance.</b> To foster competition in both the long-distance and local markets, the 1996 Act created a process by which the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Companies"" title=""Regional Bell Operating Companies"">Regional Bell Operating Companies</a> (""RBOCs"") would be free to offer long-distance service (which was not permitted under one of the terms of the 1982 Modified Final Judgement settling the government's antitrust case against the former Bell System monopoly)<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup> once they made a showing that their local markets had been opened up to competition.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup> The list of Bell Operating Companies in the bill are: Bell Telephone Company of Nevada, Illinois Bell Telephone Company, Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated, Michigan Bell Telephone Company, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, New York Telephone Company, U S West Communications Company, South Central Bell Telephone Company, Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia, The Diamond State Telephone Company, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company, The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, or Wisconsin Telephone Company.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Wholesale access to incumbents' networks.</b> To allow new entrants enough time to fully build out their own networks, the Act requires the incumbent local exchange carriers to make available to entrants, at cost-based wholesale rates, those elements of their network to which entrants needed access in order not to be impaired in their ability to offer telecommunications services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Universal service support made explicit.</b> Prior to enactment of the Act, <a href=""/wiki/Universal_service"" title=""Universal service"">universal service</a> had been funded through <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=Implicit_subsidies&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Implicit subsidies (page does not exist)"">implicit subsidies</a>, levied as above-cost business rates, urban rates, and above-cost rates for the ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Access_charge"" title=""Access charge"">access charges</a>"" that long-distance carriers paid as intercarrier compensation to local telephone companies for originating and terminating their subscribers' long-distance calls. Recognizing that new entrants would target those services that had above-cost rates, and thus erode universal service support, Congress included in the 1996 Act a provision requiring universal service support to be explicit, rather than hidden in above-cost rates.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_17-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-17"">[17]</a></sup> This requirement has only been partially implemented, however, and therefore significant implicit universal services subsidies still remain in above-cost rates for certain services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The regulatory framework created by the 1996 Act was intended to foster ""intramodal"" competition within distinct markets, i.e., among companies that used the same underlying technology to provide service.  For example, competition was envisioned between the incumbent local and long-distance wireline carriers plus new competitive local exchange carriers, all of which used circuit-switched networks to offer voice services.
</p>, <p>It did not envision the intermodal competition that has subsequently developed, such as wireless service competing with both local and long-distance wireline service, VoIP competing with wireline and wireless telephony, IP video competing with cable television. Providers from separate regulatory regimes have been brought into competition with one another as a result of subsequent deployment of digital broadband technologies in telephone and cable networks.  Voice and video services can now be provided using Internet protocol and thus might be classified as unregulated information services, but these services compete directly with regulated traditional voice and video services.  Moreover, these digital technologies do not recognize national borders, much less state boundaries.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-digital.library.unt.edu_19-0""><a href=""#cite_note-digital.library.unt.edu-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Given the focus on intramodal competition and the lack of intermodal competition, there was little concern about statutory or regulatory language that set different regulatory burdens for different technology modes. As a result, the current statutory and regulatory framework may be inconsistent with, or unresponsive to, current market conditions in several ways:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-20""><a href=""#cite_note-20"">[20]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Generally speaking, the number of broadband networks is limited by cost constraint up-front, fixed costs—which do not apply to applications providers.  In this new environment, there will be three broad categories of competition:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-digital.library.unt.edu_19-1""><a href=""#cite_note-digital.library.unt.edu-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>These three areas of competition will all be affected by a common factor: will there be entry by a third broadband network to compete with the broadband networks of the local telephone company and the local cable operator?
</p>, <p>There are four general approaches to the regulation of broadband network providers vis-a-vis independent applications providers (At present, the FCC follows the last two approaches):
</p>, <p>There is consensus<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-21""><a href=""#cite_note-21"">[21]</a></sup> that the current universal service and intercarrier compensation mechanisms need to be modified to accommodate the new market conditions.  For example, the current universal service funding mechanism is assessed only on telecommunications services, and carriers can receive universal service funding only in support of telecommunications services.  Thus, if services that had been classified as telecommunications services are re-classified as information services, as recently occurred for high-speed digital subscriber line (""DSL"") services, then the universal service assessment base will decline and carriers that depend on universal service funding may see a decline in support.  It therefore may be timely to consider whether the scope of universal service should be expanded to include universal access to a broadband network at affordable rates, not just to basic telephone service.
</p>, <p>The 1996 Telecommunications Act is divided into seven Titles:
</p>, <p><b>Title I</b>, ""Telecommunications Service"": Helps to outline the general duties of the telecommunication carriers as well as the obligations of all <a href=""/wiki/Local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Local exchange carrier"">local exchange carriers</a> (LECs) and the additional obligations of <a href=""/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Incumbent local exchange carrier"">incumbent local exchange carriers</a> (ILECs).
</p>, <p><b>Title II</b>, ""Broadcast Services"": Outlines the granting and licensing of broadcast spectrum by the government, including a provision to issue licenses to current television stations to commence <a href=""/wiki/Digital_television"" title=""Digital television"">digital television</a> broadcasting, the use of the revenues generated by such licensing, the terms of broadcast licenses, the process of renewing <a href=""/wiki/Broadcast_license"" title=""Broadcast license"">broadcast licenses</a>, direct broadcast satellite services, automated ship distress and safety systems, and restrictions on over-the-air reception devices
</p>, <p><b>Title III</b>, ""Cable Services"": Outlines the <a href=""/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984"" title=""Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984"">Cable Act</a> reform, cable services provided by telephone companies, the preemption of franchising authority regulation of telecommunication services, VHS home video programming accessibility, and competitive availability of navigation devices.
</p>, <p><b>Title IV</b>, ""Regulatory Reform"": Outlines regulatory forbearance, a biennial review of regulations, regulatory relief, and the elimination of unnecessary Commission regulations and functions.
</p>, <p><b>Title V</b>, ""Obscenity and Violence"": <style data-mw-deduplicate=""TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}</style></p>, <p>Outlines regulations regarding obscene programming on <a href=""/wiki/Cable_television"" title=""Cable television"">cable television</a>, the scrambling of cable channels for nonsubscribers, the scrambling of sexually explicit adult video service programming, the cable operators' refusal to carry certain programs, coercion and enticement of minors, and online family empowerment, including a requirement for the manufacture of televisions that block programs using <a href=""/wiki/V-chip"" title=""V-chip"">V-chip</a> technology.  Title V also gives a clarification of the current laws regarding communication of obscene materials through the use of a computer.
</p>, <p><b>Title VI</b>, ""Effect on Other Laws"" : Outlines the applicability of <a href=""/wiki/Consent_decree"" title=""Consent decree"">consent decrees</a> and other laws and the preemption of local taxation with respect to direct-to-home sales.
</p>, <p><b>Title VII</b>, ""Miscellaneous Provisions"" : Outlines provisions relating to the prevention of unfair billing practices for information or services provided over toll-free telephone calls, privacy of consumer information, pole attachments, facilities siting, radio frequency emission standards, mobile services direct access to long-distance carriers, advanced telecommunications incentives, the telecommunications development fund, the National Education Technology Funding Corporation, a report on the use of advance telecommunications services for medical purposes, and outlines the authorization of appropriations.
</p>, <p>The Act makes a significant distinction between providers of telecommunications services and information services.  The term 'telecommunications service' means the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.'  On the other hand, the term 'information service' means the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic publishing, but does not include any use of any such capability for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service.  The distinction becomes particularly important when a carrier provides information services, because the Act enforces specific regulations against 'telecommunications carriers' but not against providers of information services.  By one interpretation of the Act, a carrier providing information services is not a 'telecommunications carrier'.  For example, under this interpretation a carrier would not be a 'telecommunications carrier' when it is selling broadband Internet access.  With the convergence of telephone, cable, and internet providers, this distinction has created much controversy.  Under <a href=""/wiki/National_Cable_%26_Telecommunications_Ass%27n_v._Brand_X_Internet_Services"" title=""National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services"">BrandX</a>, the Supreme Court applied the doctrine of Chevron deference and thereby allowed the question of how to interpret the Act's ambiguous language to be decided by the FCC.
</p>, <p>The Act both deregulated and created new regulations. Congress forced local telephone companies to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forced-access"" title=""Forced-access"">share their lines with competitors</a> at regulated rates if ""the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer"" (Section 251(3)(2)(B)). This led to the creation of a new group of telephone companies, ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Competitive_Local_Exchange_Carrier"" title=""Competitive Local Exchange Carrier"">Competitive Local Exchange Carriers</a>"" (CLECs), that compete with ""ILECs"" or <a href=""/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Incumbent local exchange carrier"">incumbent local exchange carriers</a>.
</p>, <p>Most media ownership regulations were eased, and the cap on radio station ownership was eliminated.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-23""><a href=""#cite_note-23"">[23]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Title V of the 1996 Act is the <a href=""/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act"" title=""Communications Decency Act"">Communications Decency Act</a>, aimed at regulating <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a> indecency and obscenity, but was ruled unconstitutional by the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court"" title=""U.S. Supreme Court"">U.S. Supreme Court</a> for violating the <a href=""/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" title=""First Amendment to the United States Constitution"">First Amendment</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-24""><a href=""#cite_note-24"">[24]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-25""><a href=""#cite_note-25"">[25]</a></sup> Portions of Title V remain, including the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Good_Samaritan_Act"" title=""Good Samaritan Act"">Good Samaritan Act</a>, which protects ISPs from liability for third-party content on their services, and legal definitions of the Internet.
</p>, <p>The Act codified the concept of <a href=""/wiki/Universal_service"" title=""Universal service"">universal service</a> and led to creation of the <a href=""/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund"" title=""Universal Service Fund"">Universal Service Fund</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/E-rate"" title=""E-rate"">E-rate</a>. The Act employs the following <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Terms_of_art"" title=""Terms of art"">terms of art</a>: ""Information service"" which is defined as:
</p>, <p>The offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available 
information via telecommunications</p>, <p>When the smaller CLECs faced financial problems, the trend toward competition slowed, turning into a decade of reconsolidation. [Marcus] The two largest CLECs, Teleport Communications Group (TCG) and <a href=""/wiki/Metropolitan_Fiber_Systems"" title=""Metropolitan Fiber Systems"">Metropolitan Fiber Systems</a> (MFS) were acquired by <a href=""/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation"" title=""AT&amp;T Corporation"">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href=""/wiki/MCI_Communications"" title=""MCI Communications"">MCI</a>/WorldCom.
</p>, <p>Looking back five years after the bill was passed, the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Consumers_Union"" title=""Consumers Union"">Consumers Union</a> reported that wire to wire competition, the reason that sold the bill, had not succeeded as legislators had hoped. CLECs had captured just under seven percent of total lines in the country, and only three percent of homes and small businesses. Wire to wire competition accounted for only one percent of total lines nationwide.
</p>, <p>The Consumers Union also raises one other major point. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not foster competition among ILECs as the bill had hoped. Instead, of ILECs encroaching on each other, the opposite occurred  –  mergers. Before the 1996 Act was passed, the largest four ILECs owned less than half of all the lines in the country while, five years later, the largest four local telephone companies owned about 85% of all the lines in the country.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-26""><a href=""#cite_note-26"">[26]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Robert_Crandall"" title=""Robert Crandall"">Robert Crandall</a> has argued that the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forced-access"" title=""Forced-access"">forced-access</a> provisions of the 1996 Act have had little economic value, and that the primary, sustainable competitive forces in phone and related, non-'radio', telecommunications are the wireline telephone companies, the cable companies, and the wireless companies.
</p>, <p>The Act was claimed to foster competition. Instead, it continued the historic industry consolidation reducing the number of major media companies from around 50 in 1983 to 10 in 1996<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-27""><a href=""#cite_note-27"">[27]</a></sup> and 6 in 2005.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-28""><a href=""#cite_note-28"">[28]</a></sup> An FCC study found that the Act had led to a drastic decline in the number of radio station owners, even as the actual number of commercial stations in the United States had increased.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-29""><a href=""#cite_note-29"">[29]</a></sup> This decline in owners and increase in stations has reportedly had the effect of <a href=""/wiki/Radio_homogenization"" title=""Radio homogenization"">Radio homogenization</a>, where programming has become similar across formats.
</p>, <p>Consumer activist <a href=""/wiki/Ralph_Nader"" title=""Ralph Nader"">Ralph Nader</a> argued that the Act was an example of <a href=""/wiki/Corporate_welfare"" title=""Corporate welfare"">corporate welfare</a> spawned by political corruption, because it gave away to incumbent broadcasters valuable licenses for broadcasting digital signals on the public airwaves.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-30""><a href=""#cite_note-30"">[30]</a></sup> There was a requirement in the Act that the FCC not auction off the public spectrum which the FCC itself valued at $11–$70 billion.
</p>, <p>It had been specifically named in the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace"" title=""Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"">Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a> as an act ""which repudiates your own [i.e. American] Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-31""><a href=""#cite_note-31"">[31]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In later years, criticism of the Telecommunications Act continued. One commentator, Warren J.

He described this provision as ""blatantly unconstitutional"" and noted that the balance of the Act would ""shape our future"" by eliminating ""barriers between the industry's segments, e.g., local and long-distance services, broadcast and cable television, etc.""

There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example <a href=""/wiki/Antarctica"" title=""Antarctica"">Antarctica</a>, plus large regions of <a href=""/wiki/Australia"" title=""Australia"">Australia</a>, <a href=""/wiki/South_America"" title=""South America"">South America</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Africa"" title=""Africa"">Africa</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Northern_Canada"" title=""Northern Canada"">Northern Canada</a>, <a href=""/wiki/China"" title=""China"">China</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Russia"" title=""Russia"">Russia</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Greenland"" title=""Greenland"">Greenland</a>.
</p>, <p>After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_phone"" title=""Satellite phone"">mobile satellite phones</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_radio"" title=""Satellite radio"">satellite radio</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_television"" title=""Satellite television"">satellite television</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access"" title=""Satellite Internet access"">satellite Internet access</a>. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial <a href=""/wiki/Transponder_(satellite_communications)"" title=""Transponder (satellite communications)"">satellite transponder channels</a> continued to drop significantly.
</p>, <p>On 11 September 1940, <a href=""/wiki/George_Stibitz"" title=""George Stibitz"">George Stibitz</a> was able to transmit problems using <a href=""/wiki/Teleprinter"" title=""Teleprinter"">teleprinter</a> to his Complex Number Calculator in New York and receive the computed results back at <a href=""/wiki/Dartmouth_College"" title=""Dartmouth College"">Dartmouth College</a> in <a href=""/wiki/New_Hampshire"" title=""New Hampshire"">New Hampshire</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup> This configuration of a centralized computer or <a href=""/wiki/Mainframe_computer"" title=""Mainframe computer"">mainframe computer</a> with remote ""dumb terminals"" remained popular throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate <a href=""/wiki/Packet_switching"" title=""Packet switching"">packet switching</a> — a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969. This network soon became the <a href=""/wiki/ARPANET"" title=""ARPANET"">ARPANET</a>, which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>ARPANET's development centered around the Request for Comment process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of the <a href=""/wiki/Communication_protocol"" title=""Communication protocol"">communication protocols</a> that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_Protocol"" title=""Internet Protocol"">Internet Protocol</a> version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"" title=""Transmission Control Protocol"">Transmission Control Protocol</a> (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.
</p>, <p>Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and <a href=""/wiki/Computer_network"" title=""Computer network"">computer networking</a> because it is flexible and can be bundled into cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few <a href=""/wiki/Optical_communications_repeater"" title=""Optical communications repeater"">repeaters</a>.
</p>, <p>In 1966 <a href=""/wiki/Charles_K._Kao"" title=""Charles K. Kao"">Charles K. Kao</a> and <a href=""/wiki/George_Hockham"" title=""George Hockham"">George Hockham</a> proposed optical fibers at STC Laboratories (STL) at <a href=""/wiki/Harlow"" title=""Harlow"">Harlow</a>, England, when they showed that the losses of 1000 dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5-10 dB/km in coaxial cable) was due to contaminants, which could potentially be removed.
</p>, <p>Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Corning_Glass_Works"" title=""Corning Glass Works"">Corning Glass Works</a>, with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20<a href=""/wiki/Decibel"" title=""Decibel"">dB</a>/km), and at the same time GaAs (Gallium arsenide) <a href=""/wiki/Laser_diode"" title=""Laser diode"">semiconductor lasers</a> were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.
</p>, <p>After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic communications system was developed, which operated at a wavelength around 0.8 µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Mbps"" title=""Mbps"">Mbps</a> with repeater spacing of up to 10 km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.
</p>, <p>The first wide area network fibre optic cable system in the world seems to have been installed by Rediffusion in Hastings, East Sussex, UK in 1978. The cables were placed in ducting throughout the town, and had over 1000 subscribers. They were used at that time for the transmission of television channels, not available because of local reception problems.
</p>, <p>The first <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Transatlantic_telephone_cable"" title=""Transatlantic telephone cable"">transatlantic telephone cable</a> to use optical fiber was <a href=""/wiki/TAT-8"" title=""TAT-8"">TAT-8</a>, based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988.
</p>, <p>In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a>, and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as <a href=""/wiki/Video_on_demand"" title=""Video on demand"">video on demand</a>. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Internet_protocol"" title=""Internet protocol"">Internet protocol</a> data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Moore%27s_Law"" title=""Moore's Law"">Moore's Law</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>

The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary.  These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.
</p>, <p>The plant facilities can be delivered via underground facilities, either direct buried or through conduit or in some cases laid under water, via aerial facilities such as telephone or power poles, or via microwave radio signals for long distances where either of the other two methods is too costly.

"[<p>In <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a>, a <b>point-to-point</b> connection refers to a communications connection between two <a href=""/wiki/Communication_endpoint"" title=""Communication endpoint"">communication endpoints</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Node_(networking)"" title=""Node (networking)"">nodes</a>.  An example is a <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_call"" title=""Telephone call"">telephone call</a>, in which one telephone is connected with one other, and what is said by one caller can only be heard by the other.  This is contrasted with a <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Point-to-multipoint"" title=""Point-to-multipoint"">point-to-multipoint</a></i> or  <i><a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)"" title=""Broadcasting (networking)"">broadcast</a></i> connection, in which many nodes can receive information transmitted by one node.

</p>, <p>The term is also used in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Computer_networking"" title=""Computer networking"">computer networking</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Computer_architecture"" title=""Computer architecture"">computer architecture</a> to refer to a wire or other connection that links only two computers or circuits, as opposed to other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Network_topologies"" title=""Network topologies"">network topologies</a> such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Computer_bus"" title=""Computer bus"">buses</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Crossbar_switch"" title=""Crossbar switch"">crossbar switches</a> which can connect many communications devices. 
</p>, <p><i>Point-to-point</i> is sometimes abbreviated as <i><a class=""mw-redirect mw-disambig"" href=""/wiki/P2P_(disambiguation)"" title=""P2P (disambiguation)"">P2P</a></i>. This usage of <i>P2P</i> is distinct from <i>P2P</i> meaning <i><a href=""/wiki/Peer-to-peer"" title=""Peer-to-peer"">peer-to-peer</a></i> in the context of <a href=""/wiki/File_sharing"" title=""File sharing"">file sharing</a> networks or other data-sharing protocols between peers.
</p>, <p>A traditional point-to-point data link is a communications medium with exactly two endpoints and no data or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Packet_(information_technology)"" title=""Packet (information technology)"">packet</a> formatting. The host computers at either end take full responsibility for formatting the data transmitted between them. The connection between the computer and the communications medium was generally implemented through an <a href=""/wiki/RS-232"" title=""RS-232"">RS-232</a> or similar interface. Computers in close proximity may be connected by wires directly between their interface cards.
</p>, <p>When connected at a distance, each endpoint would be fitted with a <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modem</a> to convert analog telecommunications signals into a digital data stream. When the connection uses a telecommunications provider, the connection is called a <a href=""/wiki/Dedicated_line"" title=""Dedicated line"">dedicated</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Leased_line"" title=""Leased line"">leased</a>, or <a href=""/wiki/Private_line"" title=""Private line"">private line</a>. The <a href=""/wiki/ARPANET"" title=""ARPANET"">ARPANET</a> used leased lines to provide point-to-point data links between its <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Packet-switching"" title=""Packet-switching"">packet-switching</a> nodes, which were called <a href=""/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor"" title=""Interface Message Processor"">Interface Message Processors</a>.
</p>, <p>In modern computer networking, the term point-to-point telecommunications means a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Wireless_networking"" title=""Wireless networking"">wireless</a> data link between two fixed points. The telecommunications signal is typically bi-directional and either <i><a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access"" title=""Time-division multiple access"">time-division multiple access</a></i> (TDMA) or <a href=""/wiki/Channelization_(telecommunications)"" title=""Channelization (telecommunications)"">channelized</a>. This can be a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Microwave_relay"" title=""Microwave relay"">microwave relay</a> link consisting of a transmitter which transmits a narrow beam of microwaves with a <a href=""/wiki/Parabolic_antenna"" title=""Parabolic antenna"">parabolic dish</a> antenna to a second parabolic dish at the receiver.  It also includes technologies such as <a href=""/wiki/Laser"" title=""Laser"">lasers</a> which transmit data modulated on a light beam.  These technologies require an unobstructed <a href=""/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation"" title=""Line-of-sight propagation"">line of sight</a> between the two points and thus are limited by the visual horizon to distances of about 40 miles (64 km).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[a]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Local_network"" title=""Local network"">local network</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Repeater_hub"" title=""Repeater hub"">repeater hubs</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Network_switch"" title=""Network switch"">switches</a> provide basic connectivity. A hub provides a point-to-multipoint (or simply multipoint) circuit in which all connected client nodes share the network bandwidth. A switch on the other hand provides a series of point-to-point circuits, via microsegmentation, which allows each client node to have a dedicated circuit and the added advantage of having <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Full-duplex"" title=""Full-duplex"">full-duplex</a> connections.
</p>, <p>From the <a href=""/wiki/OSI_model"" title=""OSI model"">OSI model</a>'s layer perspective, both switches and repeater hubs provide point-to-point connections on the <a href=""/wiki/Physical_layer"" title=""Physical layer"">physical layer</a>. However, on the <a href=""/wiki/Data_link_layer"" title=""Data link layer"">data link layer</a>, a repeater hub provides point-to-multipoint connectivity – each <a href=""/wiki/Frame_(networking)"" title=""Frame (networking)"">frame</a> is forwarded to all nodes – while a switch provides virtual point-to-point connections – each <a href=""/wiki/Unicast"" title=""Unicast"">unicast</a> frame is only forwarded to the destination node.
</p>, <p>Within many <a href=""/wiki/Circuit_switching"" title=""Circuit switching"">switched telecommunications systems</a>, it is possible to establish a permanent circuit. One example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building, which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher. ""Nailing down"" a switched connection saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points.

</p>, <p>The term gateway can also loosely refer to a computer or computer program configured to perform the tasks of a gateway, such as a <a href=""/wiki/Default_gateway"" title=""Default gateway"">default gateway</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Router_(computing)"" title=""Router (computing)"">router</a>, and in the case of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HTTP"" title=""HTTP"">HTTP</a>, gateway is also often used as a synonym for <a href=""/wiki/Reverse_proxy"" title=""Reverse proxy"">reverse proxy</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>A network gateway provides interoperability between networks and contains devices, such as protocol translators, <a href=""/wiki/Impedance_matching"" title=""Impedance matching"">impedance matchers</a>, rate converters, <a href=""/wiki/Fault_(technology)"" title=""Fault (technology)"">fault</a> isolators, or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Signalling_(telecommunications)"" title=""Signalling (telecommunications)"">signal</a> translators. A network gateway requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between the networks using the gateway. Network gateways, known as protocol translation gateways or mapping gateways, can perform protocol conversions to connect networks with different network protocol technologies. For example, a network gateway connects an office or home <a href=""/wiki/Intranet"" title=""Intranet"">intranet</a> to the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a>. If an office or home computer user wants to load a <a href=""/wiki/Web_page"" title=""Web page"">web page</a>, at least two network gateways are accessed—one to get from the office or home network to the Internet and one to get from the Internet to the computer that serves the web page.

</p>, <p>During this period, the World Bank and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ITU"" title=""ITU"">ITU</a> had advised the Indian Government to liberalise long-distance services to release the monopoly of the state-owned DoT and VSNL and to enable competition in the long-distance carrier business which would help reduce tariff's and better the economy of the country. The Rao run government instead liberalised the local services, taking the opposite political parties into confidence and assuring foreign involvement in the long-distance business after 5 years. The country was divided into 20 telecommunication circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services. These circles were divided into category A, B and C depending on the value of the revenue in each circle. The government threw open the bids to one private company per circle along with government-owned DoT per circle. For cellular service two service providers were allowed per circle and a 15 years licence was given to each provider. During all these improvements, the government did face oppositions from <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Indian_Telephone_Industries"" title=""Indian Telephone Industries"">ITI</a>, DoT, MTNL, VSNL and other labour unions, but they managed to keep away from all the hurdles.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Dash_20-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Dash-20"">[20]</a></sup>

Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-27""><a href=""#cite_note-27"">[27]</a></sup> The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as <i>Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS)</i> which was later named as <a href=""/wiki/Bharat_Sanchar_Nigam_Limited"" title=""Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited"">Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited</a> (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted the government to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises.

</p>, <p>This was a gateway to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian telecom markets. After March 2000, the government became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators. The government further reduced licence fees for [cellular service providers and increased the allowable stake to 74% for foreign companies. Because of all these factors, the service fees finally reduced and the call costs were cut greatly enabling every common middle-class family in India to afford a cell phone.

</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/LIRNEasia"" title=""LIRNEasia"">LIRNEasia</a>'s Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index, which summarises stakeholders' perception on certain TRE dimensions, provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) anti-competitive practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.
</p>, <p>The results for India, point out to the fact that the stakeholders perceive the TRE to be most conducive for the mobile sector followed by fixed and then broadband. Other than for Access to ScarceResources the fixed sector lags behind the mobile sector. The fixed and mobile sectors have the highest scores for Tariff Regulation. Market entry also scores well for the mobile sector
as competition is well entrenched with most of the circles with 4–5 mobile service providers. The broadband sector has the lowest score in the aggregate. The low penetration of broadband of mere 3.87 against the policy objective of 9 million at the end of 2007 clearly indicates that the regulatory environment is not very conducive.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lirneasia_tre_86-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lirneasia_tre-86"">[86]</a></sup>

"[<p>A <b>duplex</b> <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communication_system"" title=""Communication system"">communication system</a> is a <a href=""/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)"" title=""Point-to-point (telecommunications)"">point-to-point</a> system composed of two or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. Duplex systems are employed in many communications networks, either to allow for simultaneous communication in both directions between two connected parties or to provide a reverse path for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. There are two types of duplex communication systems: full-duplex (FDX) and half-duplex (HDX).
</p>, <p>In a <b>full-duplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other simultaneously.  An example of a full-duplex device is <a href=""/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service"" title=""Plain old telephone service"">plain old telephone service</a>; the parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party. There is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly speaking, there are two communication channels between them.
</p>, <p>In a <b>half-duplex</b>  or <b>semiduplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An example of a half-duplex device is a <a href=""/wiki/Walkie-talkie"" title=""Walkie-talkie"">walkie-talkie</a>, a <a href=""/wiki/Two-way_radio"" title=""Two-way radio"">two-way radio</a> that has a <a href=""/wiki/Push-to-talk"" title=""Push-to-talk"">push-to-talk</a> button. When the local user wants to speak to the remote person, they push this button, which turns on the transmitter and turns off the receiver, preventing them from hearing the remote person while talking. To listen to the remote person, they release the button, which turns on the receiver and turns off the transmitter.
</p>, <p>Systems that do not need duplex capability may instead use <a href=""/wiki/Simplex_communication"" title=""Simplex communication"">simplex communication</a>, in which one device transmits and the others can only listen.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup> Examples are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadcast"" title=""Broadcast"">broadcast</a> radio and television, <a href=""/wiki/Garage_door_opener"" title=""Garage door opener"">garage door openers</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Baby_monitor"" title=""Baby monitor"">baby monitors</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Wireless_microphone"" title=""Wireless microphone"">wireless microphones</a>, and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Surveillance_camera"" title=""Surveillance camera"">surveillance cameras</a>. In these devices, the communication is only in one direction.
</p>, <p>A <i>half-duplex</i> (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmission to complete, before replying.
</p>, <p>An example of a half-duplex system is a two-party system such as a <a href=""/wiki/Walkie-talkie"" title=""Walkie-talkie"">walkie-talkie</a>, wherein one must use ""over"" or another previously designated keyword to indicate the end of transmission and ensure that only one party transmits at a time. An analogy for a half-duplex system would be a one-lane section of road with traffic controllers at each end. Traffic can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time, regulated by the traffic controllers.
</p>, <p>Half-duplex systems are usually used to conserve <a href=""/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" title=""Bandwidth (signal processing)"">bandwidth</a>, at the cost of reducing the overall bidirectional throughput, since only a single <a href=""/wiki/Communication_channel"" title=""Communication channel"">communication channel</a> is needed and is shared alternately between the two directions. For example, a walkie-talkie or a DECT phone or so-called TDD 4G or 5G phones requires only a single <a href=""/wiki/Frequency"" title=""Frequency"">frequency</a> for bidirectional communication, while a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cell_phone"" title=""Cell phone"">cell phone</a> in the so-called FDD mode, is a full-duplex device, and generally requires two frequencies to carry the two simultaneous voice channels, one in each direction.
</p>, <p>In automatic communications systems such as two-way data-links, <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> can be used for time allocations for communications in a half-duplex system. For example, station A on one end of the data link could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, then station B on the other end could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, and then the cycle repeats. In this scheme, the channel is never left idle. 
</p>, <p>In half-duplex systems, if more than one party transmits at the same time, a <a href=""/wiki/Collision_(telecommunications)"" title=""Collision (telecommunications)"">collision</a> occurs, resulting in lost or distorted messages.
</p>, <p>A <i>full-duplex</i> (FDX) system allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-2""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Land-line <a href=""/wiki/Telephone"" title=""Telephone"">telephone</a> networks are full-duplex since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time. Full-duplex operation is achieved on a <a href=""/wiki/Two-wire_circuit"" title=""Two-wire circuit"">two-wire circuit</a> through the use of a <a href=""/wiki/Hybrid_coil"" title=""Hybrid coil"">hybrid coil</a> in a <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_hybrid"" title=""Telephone hybrid"">telephone hybrid</a>. Modern cell phones are also full-duplex.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There is a technical distinction between full-duplex communication, using a single physical communication channel for both directions simultaneously and <b>dual-simplex</b> communication that uses two distinct channels, one for each direction. From the user perspective, the technical difference doesn't matter and both variants are commonly referred to as <i>full duplex</i>.
</p>, <p>Many <a href=""/wiki/Ethernet"" title=""Ethernet"">Ethernet</a> connections achieve full-duplex operation by making simultaneous use of two physical <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">twisted pairs</a> inside the same jacket, or two optical fibers which are directly connected to each networked device: one pair or fiber is for receiving packets, while the other is for sending packets. Other Ethernet variants, such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/1000BASE-T"" title=""1000BASE-T"">1000BASE-T</a> use the same channels in each direction simultaneously. In any case, with full-duplex operation, the cable itself becomes a collision-free environment and doubles the maximum total transmission capacity supported by each Ethernet connection.
</p>, <p>Full-duplex has also several benefits over the use of half-duplex. Since there is only one transmitter on each twisted pair there is no contention and no collisions so time is not wasted by having to wait or retransmit frames. Full transmission capacity is available in both directions because the send and receive functions are separate.
</p>, <p>Some computer-based systems of the 1960s and 1970s required full-duplex facilities, even for half-duplex operation, since their poll-and-response schemes could not tolerate the slight delays in reversing the direction of transmission in a half-duplex line.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)"">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>, <p>Full-duplex audio systems like telephones can create echo, which is distracting to users and impedes the performance of modems. Echo occurs when the sound originating from the far end comes out of the speaker at the near end and re-enters the microphone<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[a]</a></sup> there and is then sent back to the far end. The sound then reappears at the original source end but delayed. 
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Echo_cancellation"" title=""Echo cancellation"">Echo cancellation</a> is a signal-processing operation that subtracts the far-end signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network. Echo cancellation is important technology allowing <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modems</a> to achieve good full-duplex performance. The V.32, V.34, V.56, and V.90 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ITU-T_V-Series_Recommendations"" title=""ITU-T V-Series Recommendations"">modem standards</a> require echo cancellation.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[3]</a></sup> Echo cancelers are available as both software and hardware implementations. They can be independent components in a communications system or integrated into the communication system's <a href=""/wiki/Central_processing_unit"" title=""Central processing unit"">central processing unit</a>.
</p>, <p>Where <a href=""/wiki/Channel_access_method"" title=""Channel access method"">channel access methods</a> are used in <a href=""/wiki/Point-to-multipoint_communication"" title=""Point-to-multipoint communication"">point-to-multipoint</a> networks (such as <a href=""/wiki/Cellular_network"" title=""Cellular network"">cellular networks</a>) for dividing forward and reverse communication channels on the same physical communications medium, they are known as duplexing methods.
</p>, <p><b>Time-division duplexing</b> (TDD) is the application of <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> to separate outward and return signals. It emulates full-duplex communication over a half-duplex communication link.
</p>, <p>Time-division duplexing is flexible in the case where there is <a href=""/wiki/Asymmetry"" title=""Asymmetry"">asymmetry</a> of the <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_link"" title=""Telecommunications link"">uplink</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Downlink"" title=""Downlink"">downlink</a> data rates or utilization. As the amount of uplink data increases, more communication capacity can be dynamically allocated, and as the traffic load becomes lighter, capacity can be taken away. The same applies in the downlink direction. 
</p>, <p>The <i>transmit/receive transition gap</i> (TTG) is the gap (time) between a downlink burst and the subsequent uplink burst. Similarly, the <i>receive/transmit transition gap</i> (RTG) is the gap between an uplink burst and the subsequent downlink burst.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Examples of time-division duplexing systems include:
</p>, <p><b>Frequency-division duplexing</b> (FDD) means that the <a href=""/wiki/Transmitter"" title=""Transmitter"">transmitter</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"" title=""Receiver (radio)"">receiver</a> operate using different <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_frequencies"" title=""Carrier frequencies"">carrier frequencies</a>. 
</p>, <p>The method is frequently used in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ham_radio"" title=""Ham radio"">ham radio</a> operation, where an operator is attempting to use a <a href=""/wiki/Repeater"" title=""Repeater"">repeater</a> station. The repeater station must be able to send and receive a transmission at the same time and does so by slightly altering the frequency at which it sends and receives.  This mode of operation is referred to as <i>duplex mode</i> or <i>offset mode</i>. Uplink and downlink sub-bands are said to be separated by the <i>frequency offset</i>. 
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplex systems can extend their range by using sets of simple repeater stations because the communications transmitted on any single frequency always travel in the same direction.
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplexing can be efficient in the case of symmetric traffic. In this case, time-division duplexing tends to waste bandwidth during the switch-over from transmitting to receiving, has greater inherent <a href=""/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"" title=""Latency (engineering)"">latency</a>, and may require more complex <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuitry"" title=""Circuitry"">circuitry</a>.
</p>, <p>Another advantage of frequency-division duplexing is that it makes radio planning easier and more efficient since base stations do not <i>hear</i> each other (as they transmit and receive in different sub-bands) and therefore will normally not interfere with each other. Conversely, with time-division duplexing systems, care must be taken to keep guard times between neighboring base stations (which decreases <a href=""/wiki/Spectral_efficiency"" title=""Spectral efficiency"">spectral efficiency</a>) or to synchronize base stations, so that they will transmit and receive at the same time (which increases network complexity and therefore cost, and reduces bandwidth allocation flexibility as all base stations and sectors will be forced to use the same uplink/downlink ratio).

</p>, <p>According to <i>Article 1.3</i> of the <a href=""/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations"" title=""ITU Radio Regulations"">Radio Regulations</a> (RR), telecommunication is defined as <i>« Any <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)"" title=""Transmission (telecommunications)"">transmission</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Emission_(radiocommunications)"" title=""Emission (radiocommunications)"">emission</a> or reception of signs, signals, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by <a href=""/wiki/Wire"" title=""Wire"">wire</a>, radio, optical, or other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Electromagnetic"" title=""Electromagnetic"">electromagnetic</a> systems</i>.» This definition is identical to those contained in the Annex to the <a href=""/wiki/Constitution_and_Convention_of_the_International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union"">Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union</a> (Geneva, 1992).
</p>, <p>The early telecommunication networks were created with copper wires as the physical medium for signal transmission. For many years, these networks were used for basic phone services, namely voice and telegrams. Since the mid-1990s, as the internet has grown in popularity, voice has been gradually supplanted by data. This soon demonstrated the limitations of copper in data transmission, prompting the development of optics.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:11_3-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:11-3"">[3]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>In the Middle Ages, chains of <a href=""/wiki/Beacon"" title=""Beacon"">beacons</a> were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as ""the enemy has been sighted"" had to be agreed upon in advance.

</p>, <p>Modern telecommunication is founded on a series of key concepts that experienced progressive development and refinement in a period of well over a century.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication technologies may primarily be divided into wired and wireless methods. Overall though, a basic <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communication_system"" title=""Communication system"">telecommunication system</a> consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:
</p>, <p>For example, in a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Radio_station"" title=""Radio station"">radio broadcasting station</a> the station's large <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Power_amplifier"" title=""Power amplifier"">power amplifier</a> is the transmitter; and the broadcasting <a href=""/wiki/Antenna_(radio)"" title=""Antenna (radio)"">antenna</a> is the interface between the power amplifier and the ""free space channel"". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the <a href=""/wiki/Radio_receiver"" title=""Radio receiver"">radio receiver</a> is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.
</p>, <p>Sometimes, telecommunication systems are <a href=""/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)"" title=""Duplex (telecommunications)"">""duplex""</a> (two-way systems) with a single box of <a href=""/wiki/Electronics"" title=""Electronics"">electronics</a> working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a <i>transceiver</i>. For example, a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cellular_telephone"" title=""Cellular telephone"">cellular telephone</a> is a transceiver.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-0""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup> The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in watts or kilowatts, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Microwatt"" title=""Microwatt"">microwatts</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Nanowatt"" title=""Nanowatt"">nanowatts</a>. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication over fixed lines is called <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Point-to-point_communication"" title=""Point-to-point communication"">point-to-point communication</a> because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called <a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting"" title=""Broadcasting"">broadcast communication</a> because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-1""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Telecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called <a href=""/wiki/Multiplexing"" title=""Multiplexing"">multiplex systems</a>. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.
</p>, <p>Communications signals can be sent either by <a href=""/wiki/Analog_signal"" title=""Analog signal"">analog signals</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Digital_signal_(electronics)"" title=""Digital signal (electronics)"">digital signals</a>. There are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Analog_communication"" title=""Analog communication"">analog communication</a> systems and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Digital_communication"" title=""Digital communication"">digital communication</a> systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by <a href=""/wiki/Noise_(signal_processing)"" title=""Noise (signal processing)"">undesirable physical noise</a>. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Random_process"" title=""Random process"">random way</a>. This form of noise is called <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Additive_noise"" title=""Additive noise"">additive noise</a>, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.
</p>, <p>On the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-77""><a href=""#cite_note-77"">[77]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The term ""channel"" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the <a href=""/wiki/Atmosphere"" title=""Atmosphere"">atmosphere</a> for sound communications, glass <a href=""/wiki/Optical_fiber"" title=""Optical fiber"">optical fibers</a> for some kinds of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Optical_communications"" title=""Optical communications"">optical communications</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Coaxial_cable"" title=""Coaxial cable"">coaxial cables</a> for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and <a href=""/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication"" title=""Free-space optical communication"">free space</a> for communications using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Visible_light"" title=""Visible light"">visible light</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Infrared"" title=""Infrared"">infrared</a> waves, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ultraviolet_light"" title=""Ultraviolet light"">ultraviolet light</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Radio_wave"" title=""Radio wave"">radio waves</a>. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or ""radio guide"", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-78""><a href=""#cite_note-78"">[78]</a></sup> This last channel is called the ""free space channel"". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect <a href=""/wiki/Vacuum"" title=""Vacuum"">vacuum</a> just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.
</p>, <p>The other meaning of the term ""channel"" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Channel_(communications)"" title=""Channel (communications)"">communications channel</a>, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/MHz"" title=""MHz"">MHz</a> (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1 MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency <a href=""/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" title=""Bandwidth (signal processing)"">bandwidth</a> of about 180 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/KHz"" title=""KHz"">kHz</a> (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the <a href=""/wiki/Carrier_wave"" title=""Carrier wave"">""carrier frequencies""</a>. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200 kHz, and the difference between 200 kHz and 180 kHz (20 kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.
</p>, <p>In the example above, the ""free space channel"" has been divided into communications channels according to <a href=""/wiki/Frequency"" title=""Frequency"">frequencies</a>, and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called ""<a href=""/wiki/Frequency-division_multiplexing"" title=""Frequency-division multiplexing"">frequency-division multiplexing</a>"".  Another term for the same concept is ""<a href=""/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing"" title=""Wavelength-division multiplexing"">wavelength-division multiplexing</a>"", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.
</p>, <p>Another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a ""time slot"", for example, 20 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Milliseconds"" title=""Milliseconds"">milliseconds</a> out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called ""<a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a>"" (<b>TDM</b>), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.
</p>, <p>The shaping of a signal to convey information is known as <a href=""/wiki/Modulation"" title=""Modulation"">modulation</a>. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called <a href=""/wiki/Keying_(telecommunications)"" title=""Keying (telecommunications)"">""keying""</a>—a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications—and several keying techniques exist (these include <a href=""/wiki/Phase-shift_keying"" title=""Phase-shift keying"">phase-shift keying</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"" title=""Frequency-shift keying"">frequency-shift keying</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying"" title=""Amplitude-shift keying"">amplitude-shift keying</a>). The ""<a href=""/wiki/Bluetooth"" title=""Bluetooth"">Bluetooth</a>"" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-79""><a href=""#cite_note-79"">[79]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-80""><a href=""#cite_note-80"">[80]</a></sup> In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) ""<a href=""/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation"" title=""Quadrature amplitude modulation"">quadrature amplitude modulation</a>"" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.
</p>, <p>Modulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the ""<a href=""/wiki/Carrier_wave"" title=""Carrier wave"">carrier wave</a>"") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being <a href=""/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"" title=""Amplitude modulation"">amplitude modulation</a> (AM) and <a href=""/wiki/Frequency_modulation"" title=""Frequency modulation"">frequency modulation</a> (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96 MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel ""96 FM"").<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-81""><a href=""#cite_note-81"">[81]</a></sup> In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).
</p>, <p>A <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_network"" title=""Telecommunications network"">telecommunications network</a> is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communications_channel"" title=""Communications channel"">communications channels</a> that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more <a href=""/wiki/Router_(computing)"" title=""Router (computing)"">routers</a> that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telephone_switch"" title=""Telephone switch"">switches</a> that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of networks, <a href=""/wiki/Repeater"" title=""Repeater"">repeaters</a> may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat <a href=""/wiki/Attenuation"" title=""Attenuation"">attenuation</a> that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-glossary_82-0""><a href=""#cite_note-glossary-82"">[82]</a></sup>
Another advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecommunication_industry"" title=""Telecommunication industry"">telecommunication industry</a>'s revenue at US$4.7 trillion or just under three percent of the <a href=""/wiki/Gross_world_product"" title=""Gross world product"">gross world product</a> (official exchange rate).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-plunkettresearch01_74-2""><a href=""#cite_note-plunkettresearch01-74"">[74]</a></sup> Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.
</p>, <p>On the <a href=""/wiki/Microeconomics"" title=""Microeconomics"">microeconomic</a> scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Amazon.com"" title=""Amazon.com"">Amazon.com</a> but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer <a href=""/wiki/Walmart"" title=""Walmart"">Walmart</a> has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-83""><a href=""#cite_note-83"">[83]</a></sup> In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In <a href=""/wiki/Bangladesh"" title=""Bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a>'s <a href=""/wiki/Narsingdi_District"" title=""Narsingdi District"">Narsingdi District</a>, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In <a href=""/wiki/Ivory_Coast"" title=""Ivory Coast"">Côte d'Ivoire</a>, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-84""><a href=""#cite_note-84"">[84]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>On the <a href=""/wiki/Macroeconomics"" title=""Macroeconomics"">macroeconomic</a> scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and <a href=""/wiki/Leonard_Waverman"" title=""Leonard Waverman"">Leonard Waverman</a> suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-85""><a href=""#cite_note-85"">[85]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-86""><a href=""#cite_note-86"">[86]</a></sup> Few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-87""><a href=""#cite_note-87"">[87]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Because of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as the <a href=""/wiki/Digital_divide"" title=""Digital divide"">digital divide</a>. A 2003 survey by the <a href=""/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""International Telecommunication Union"">International Telecommunication Union</a> (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-88""><a href=""#cite_note-88"">[88]</a></sup> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and <a href=""/wiki/Iceland"" title=""Iceland"">Iceland</a> received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-89""><a href=""#cite_note-89"">[89]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-fischer_90-0""><a href=""#cite_note-fischer-90"">[90]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Since then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Social_networking_site"" title=""Social networking site"">social networking sites</a> has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to <a href=""/wiki/Courtship"" title=""Courtship"">courtship</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-91""><a href=""#cite_note-91"">[91]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Prior to social networking sites, technologies like <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Short_message_service"" title=""Short message service"">short message service</a> (SMS) and the telephone also had a significant impact on social interactions. In 2000, market research group <a href=""/wiki/Ipsos_MORI"" title=""Ipsos MORI"">Ipsos MORI</a> reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-92""><a href=""#cite_note-92"">[92]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before in their own home without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has also transformed the way people receive their news. A 2006 survey (right table) of slightly more than 3,000 Americans by the non-profit Pew Internet and American Life Project in the United States the majority specified television or radio over newspapers.
</p>, <p>Telecommunication has had an equally significant impact on advertising. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TNS_Media_Intelligence"" title=""TNS Media Intelligence"">TNS Media Intelligence</a> reported that in 2007, 58% of advertising expenditure in the United States was spent on media that depend upon telecommunication.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-94""><a href=""#cite_note-94"">[94]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Many countries have enacted legislation which conforms to the <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=International_Telecommunication_Regulations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""International Telecommunication Regulations (page does not exist)"">International Telecommunication Regulations</a> established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which is the ""leading UN agency for information and communication technology issues"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-95""><a href=""#cite_note-95"">[95]</a></sup> In 1947, at the Atlantic City Conference, the ITU decided to ""afford international protection to all frequencies registered in a new international frequency list and used in conformity with the Radio Regulation"". According to the ITU's <i>Radio Regulations</i> adopted in Atlantic City, all frequencies referenced in the <i>International Frequency Registration Board</i>, examined by the board and registered on the <i>International Frequency List</i> ""shall have the right to international protection from harmful interference"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-96""><a href=""#cite_note-96"">[96]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>From a global perspective, there have been political debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The <a href=""/wiki/History_of_broadcasting"" title=""History of broadcasting"">history of broadcasting</a> discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup> The onset of <a href=""/wiki/World_War_II"" title=""World War II"">World War II</a> brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup> Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Wood_97-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Wood-97"">[97]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Garfield_98-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Garfield-98"">[98]</a></sup> Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s.

</p>, <p>Modern insurgents, such as those in the latest <a href=""/wiki/Iraq_War"" title=""Iraq War"">Iraq War</a>, often use intimidating telephone calls, SMSs and the distribution of sophisticated videos of an attack on coalition troops within hours of the operation. ""The Sunni insurgents even have their own television station, <a href=""/wiki/Al-Zawraa_TV"" title=""Al-Zawraa TV"">Al-Zawraa</a>, which while banned by the Iraqi government, still broadcasts from <a href=""/wiki/Erbil"" title=""Erbil"">Erbil</a>, Iraqi Kurdistan, even as coalition pressure has forced it to switch satellite hosts several times.""<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Garfield_98-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Garfield-98"">[98]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>According to data collected by Gartner<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-101""><a href=""#cite_note-101"">[101]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-102""><a href=""#cite_note-102"">[102]</a></sup> and Ars Technica<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-103""><a href=""#cite_note-103"">[103]</a></sup> sales of main consumer's telecommunication equipment worldwide in millions of units was:
</p>, <p>In a telephone network, the caller is connected to the person to whom they wish to talk by switches at various <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telephone_exchanges"" title=""Telephone exchanges"">telephone exchanges</a>. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller <a href=""/wiki/Pulse_dialing"" title=""Pulse dialing"">dials</a> the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small <a href=""/wiki/Microphone"" title=""Microphone"">microphone</a> in the caller's <a href=""/wiki/Handset"" title=""Handset"">handset</a>. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small <a href=""/wiki/Loudspeaker"" title=""Loudspeaker"">speaker</a> in that person's handset.
</p>, <p>As of 2015, the landline telephones in most residential homes are analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-104""><a href=""#cite_note-104"">[104]</a></sup> Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long-distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).
</p>, <p>Mobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-105""><a href=""#cite_note-105"">[105]</a></sup> In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-106""><a href=""#cite_note-106"">[106]</a></sup> Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as <a href=""/wiki/GSM"" title=""GSM"">GSM</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/W-CDMA"" title=""W-CDMA"">W-CDMA</a> with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as <a href=""/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System"" title=""Advanced Mobile Phone System"">AMPS</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-107""><a href=""#cite_note-107"">[107]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of <a href=""/wiki/TAT-8"" title=""TAT-8"">TAT-8</a> in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optical fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optical fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-108""><a href=""#cite_note-108"">[108]</a></sup> This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optical fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics)"" title=""Crosstalk (electronics)"">crosstalk</a> which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-109""><a href=""#cite_note-109"">[109]</a></sup> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-110""><a href=""#cite_note-110"">[110]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-111""><a href=""#cite_note-111"">[111]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Assisting communication across many modern optical fibre networks is a protocol known as <a href=""/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode"" title=""Asynchronous Transfer Mode"">Asynchronous Transfer Mode</a> (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Data_transmission"" title=""Data transmission"">data transmission</a> mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a <a href=""/wiki/Traffic_contract"" title=""Traffic contract"">traffic contract</a> with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-112""><a href=""#cite_note-112"">[112]</a></sup> There are competitors to ATM, such as <a href=""/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching"" title=""Multiprotocol Label Switching"">Multiprotocol Label Switching</a> (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-113""><a href=""#cite_note-113"">[113]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-114""><a href=""#cite_note-114"">[114]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In a broadcast system, the central high-powered <a href=""/wiki/Radio_masts_and_towers"" title=""Radio masts and towers"">broadcast tower</a> transmits a high-frequency <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave"" title=""Electromagnetic wave"">electromagnetic wave</a> to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then <a href=""/wiki/Antenna_tuner"" title=""Antenna tuner"">tuned</a> so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Demodulator"" title=""Demodulator"">demodulator</a> is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-stallings-intro_76-2""><a href=""#cite_note-stallings-intro-76"">[76]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-115""><a href=""#cite_note-115"">[115]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadcast_media_industry"" title=""Broadcast media industry"">broadcast media industry</a> is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable <a href=""/wiki/Integrated_circuit"" title=""Integrated circuit"">integrated circuits</a>. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as <a href=""/wiki/Noise_(video)"" title=""Noise (video)"">snowy pictures</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Television_interference_(ghosting)"" title=""Television interference (ghosting)"">ghosting</a> and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011— a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forward_error_correction"" title=""Forward error correction"">forward error correction</a> a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-116""><a href=""#cite_note-116"">[116]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-117""><a href=""#cite_note-117"">[117]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ATSC_Standards"" title=""ATSC Standards"">ATSC</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Digital_Video_Broadcasting"" title=""Digital Video Broadcasting"">DVB</a> and <a href=""/wiki/ISDB"" title=""ISDB"">ISDB</a> standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use <a href=""/wiki/MPEG-2"" title=""MPEG-2"">MPEG-2</a> for video compression. ATSC uses <a href=""/wiki/Dolby_Digital"" title=""Dolby Digital"">Dolby Digital</a> AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses <a href=""/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding"" title=""Advanced Audio Coding"">Advanced Audio Coding</a> (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses <a href=""/wiki/MPEG-1"" title=""MPEG-1"">MPEG-1</a> Part 3 Layer 2.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-118""><a href=""#cite_note-118"">[118]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-119""><a href=""#cite_note-119"">[119]</a></sup> The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the <a href=""/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting"" title=""Digital Audio Broadcasting"">Digital Audio Broadcasting</a> standard (also known as the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Eureka_147"" title=""Eureka 147"">Eureka 147</a> standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt <a href=""/wiki/HD_Radio"" title=""HD Radio"">HD Radio</a>. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as <a href=""/wiki/In-band_on-channel"" title=""In-band on-channel"">in-band on-channel</a> transmission that allows digital information to ""piggyback"" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-120""><a href=""#cite_note-120"">[120]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>However, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-121""><a href=""#cite_note-121"">[121]</a></sup> after twice delaying the switchover deadline. Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there were three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption <a href=""/wiki/File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png"" title=""File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png"">here</a>). These are known as <a href=""/wiki/PAL"" title=""PAL"">PAL</a> (German designed), <a href=""/wiki/NTSC"" title=""NTSC"">NTSC</a> (American designed), and <a href=""/wiki/SECAM"" title=""SECAM"">SECAM</a> (French-designed). For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the higher cost of digital receivers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-122""><a href=""#cite_note-122"">[122]</a></sup> The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (<b>AM</b>) or frequency modulation (<b>FM</b>). To achieve <a href=""/wiki/Stereophonic_sound"" title=""Stereophonic sound"">stereo playback</a>, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Stereo_FM"" title=""Stereo FM"">stereo FM</a>, and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or <a href=""/wiki/C-QUAM"" title=""C-QUAM"">C-QUAM</a>.
</p>, <p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_Protocol"" title=""Internet Protocol"">Internet Protocol</a> (IP).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-123""><a href=""#cite_note-123"">[123]</a></sup> Any computer on the Internet has a unique <a href=""/wiki/IP_address"" title=""IP address"">IP address</a> that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-124""><a href=""#cite_note-124"">[124]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>It is estimated that 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Landline_telephone"" title=""Landline telephone"">landline telephone</a>). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Mobile_phones"" title=""Mobile phones"">mobile phones</a>).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-HilbertLopez2011_72-1""><a href=""#cite_note-HilbertLopez2011-72"">[72]</a></sup> As of 2008<sup class=""plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update"" style=""display:none;""><a class=""external text"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Telecommunications&amp;action=edit"">[update]</a></sup>, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-125""><a href=""#cite_note-125"">[125]</a></sup> In terms of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access"" title=""Broadband Internet access"">broadband access</a>, Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-126""><a href=""#cite_note-126"">[126]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The Internet works in part because of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communications_protocol"" title=""Communications protocol"">protocols</a> that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Internet_browser"" title=""Internet browser"">Internet browser</a> to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or <a href=""/wiki/Wi-Fi"" title=""Wi-Fi"">Wi-Fi</a> connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-127""><a href=""#cite_note-127"">[127]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>For the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.
</p>, <p>At the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for <a href=""/wiki/Logical_address"" title=""Logical address"">logical addressing</a>. For the World Wide Web, these ""IP addresses"" are derived from the human-readable form using the <a href=""/wiki/Domain_Name_System"" title=""Domain Name System"">Domain Name System</a> (e.g. 72.14.207.99 is derived from www.google.com). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-128""><a href=""#cite_note-128"">[128]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>At the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the <a href=""/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"" title=""User Datagram Protocol"">User Datagram Protocol</a> (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered nor retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TCP_and_UDP_port"" title=""TCP and UDP port"">port numbers</a> with them to specify what application or <a href=""/wiki/Process_(computing)"" title=""Process (computing)"">process</a> the packet should be handled by.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-129""><a href=""#cite_note-129"">[129]</a></sup> Because certain application-level protocols use <a href=""/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"" title=""List of TCP and UDP port numbers"">certain ports</a>, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning <a href=""/wiki/WAN_optimization"" title=""WAN optimization"">priority</a>.
</p>, <p>Above the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer"" title=""Secure Sockets Layer"">Secure Sockets Layer</a> (SSL) and <a href=""/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"" title=""Transport Layer Security"">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-130""><a href=""#cite_note-130"">[130]</a></sup> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HTTP"" title=""HTTP"">HTTP</a> (web browsing), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/POP3"" title=""POP3"">POP3</a> (e-mail), <a href=""/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol"" title=""File Transfer Protocol"">FTP</a> (file transfer), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/IRC"" title=""IRC"">IRC</a> (Internet chat), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)"" title=""BitTorrent (protocol)"">BitTorrent</a> (file sharing) and <a href=""/wiki/XMPP"" title=""XMPP"">XMPP</a> (instant messaging).
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/VoIP"" title=""VoIP"">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Synchronous"" title=""Synchronous"">synchronous</a> voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate-style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-131""><a href=""#cite_note-131"">[131]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Despite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of <a href=""/wiki/Local_area_network"" title=""Local area network"">local area networks</a> (LANs)—computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Wide_area_network"" title=""Wide area network"">Wide area networks</a> (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.
</p>, <p>In the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/OSI_reference_model"" title=""OSI reference model"">OSI reference model</a>. These included <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Appletalk"" title=""Appletalk"">Appletalk</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/IPX"" title=""IPX"">IPX</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/NetBIOS"" title=""NetBIOS"">NetBIOS</a> with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with <a href=""/wiki/MS-DOS"" title=""MS-DOS"">MS-DOS</a> users. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/TCP/IP"" title=""TCP/IP"">TCP/IP</a> existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-132""><a href=""#cite_note-132"">[132]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>As the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/DHCP"" title=""DHCP"">DHCP</a>, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-133""><a href=""#cite_note-133"">[133]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as <a href=""/wiki/Quality_of_service"" title=""Quality of service"">quality of service</a> guarantees, and offer <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection"" title=""Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection"">collision prevention</a>. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-134""><a href=""#cite_note-134"">[134]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Despite the modest popularity of Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">copper twisted-pair cables</a> (including the common <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/10BASE-T"" title=""10BASE-T"">10BASE-T</a> networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-135""><a href=""#cite_note-135"">[135]</a></sup> When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. <a href=""/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber"" title=""Multi-mode optical fiber"">Multimode fibers</a> can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffer from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation—implying poorer long-distance performance.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-136""><a href=""#cite_note-136"">[136]</a></sup>

Its development level is high, with close accessibility to the infrastructure from nearly all inhabited parts of the island and for all of the population, with exceptions. Today, the country is considered an international telecommunications hub, an achievement that was driven by Singapore's view that high-quality telecommunications is one of the critical factors that support its economic growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>After reform initiatives, the Singaporean telecommunication industry became streamlined and largely directed by the government, which viewed such policy as critical in shaping societal preferences and in directing the state's economy.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup> Being able to provide adequate telecommunications services is also critical when approached from the perspective that Singapore's legitimacy as a state rests on its capability to deliver a high standard of living to its citizens. Hence, beginning in the 1970s, the state pursued a three-phase strategy oriented towards developing world-class telecommunications infrastructure capable of high-quality telecommunications services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The first phase involved the expansion of infrastructure to meet business and societal needs (e.g. service enhancement, reduction of waiting lists for telephone connections). The second phase involved the integration of telecommunications to the over-all state strategy, particularly in the area of services for banking, financial services, and tourism with the goal of tapping telecommunications in ensuring the competitive advantage for Singapore.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup> The National Computer Board was formed during this period for the purpose of developing and adopting IT applications. In 1986, this agency issued Singapore's comprehensive National Information Technology Plan (NITP).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:2_3-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:2-3"">[3]</a></sup> By the late 1980s, the third phase commenced and it focused on bolstering Singapore's international role as well as the IT 2000, which was an ambitious plan to encourage new multimedia services, which is articulated in the promotion of Singapore as ""an intelligent island"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_2-2""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-2"">[2]</a></sup>

The Act, signed by President <a href=""/wiki/Bill_Clinton"" title=""Bill Clinton"">Bill Clinton</a>, represented a major change in American telecommunication law, since it was the first time that the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_in_the_United_States"" title=""Internet in the United States"">Internet</a> was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-fcc.gov_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-fcc.gov-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>According to the <a href=""/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission"" title=""Federal Communications Commission"">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), the goal of the law was to ""let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business <a href=""/wiki/Competition_(economics)"" title=""Competition (economics)"">compete</a> in any market against any other.""<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup> The legislation's primary goal was <a href=""/wiki/Deregulation"" title=""Deregulation"">deregulation</a> of the converging <a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting_in_the_United_States"" title=""Broadcasting in the United States"">broadcasting</a> and telecommunications markets.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> However, the law's regulatory policies have been questioned, including the effects of dualistic re-regulation of the communications market.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Previously, the <a href=""/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934"" title=""Communications Act of 1934"">Communications Act of 1934</a> (""1934 Act"") was the statutory framework for U.S. communications policy, covering telecommunications and broadcasting.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_6-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-6"">[6]</a></sup> The 1934 Act created the FCC,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:1_6-1""><a href=""#cite_note-:1-6"">[6]</a></sup> the agency formed to implement and administer the economic regulation of the interstate activities of the telephone monopolies and the licensing of spectrum used for broadcast and other purposes. The Act left most regulation of intrastate telephone services to the states.
</p>, <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, a combination of technological change, court decisions, and changes in U.S. policy permitted competitive entry into some telecommunications and broadcast markets. In this context, the 1996 Telecommunications Act was designed to allow fewer, but larger corporations, to operate more media enterprises within a sector (such as Clear Channel's dominance in radio), and to expand across media sectors (through relaxation of cross-ownership rules), thus enabling massive and historic consolidation of media in the United States.  These changes amounted to a near-total rollback of New Deal market regulation.
</p>, <p>The 1996 Act's stated objective was to open up markets to competition by removing regulatory barriers to entry: The conference report refers to the bill ""to provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The Act was approved by the <a href=""/wiki/104th_United_States_Congress"" title=""104th United States Congress"">104th Congress</a> on January 3, 1996, and was signed into law on February 8, 1996, by President <a href=""/wiki/Bill_Clinton"" title=""Bill Clinton"">Bill Clinton</a>. It was the first bill signed at the <a href=""/wiki/Library_of_Congress"" title=""Library of Congress"">Library of Congress</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>A purpose of the 1996 Act was to foster competition among companies that use similar underlying network technologies (e.g., <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuit-switched"" title=""Circuit-switched"">circuit-switched</a> telephone networks) to provide a single type of service (e.g., voice). For example, it creates separate regulatory regimes for carriers providing voice telephone service and providers of <a href=""/wiki/Cable_television"" title=""Cable television"">cable television</a>, and a third for information services.
</p>, <p><b>Preemption.</b> One key provision allowed the FCC to preempt state or local legal requirements that acted as a barrier to entry in the provision of interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Interconnectedness.</b> Since communications services exhibit <a href=""/wiki/Network_effect"" title=""Network effect"">network effects</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Positive_externalities"" title=""Positive externalities"">positive externalities</a>, new entrants would face <a href=""/wiki/Barriers_to_entry"" title=""Barriers to entry"">barriers to entry</a> if they could not interconnect their networks with those of the incumbent carriers.  Thus, another key provision of the 1996 Act sets obligations for incumbent carriers and new entrants to interconnect their networks with one another, imposing additional requirements on the incumbents because they might desire to restrict competitive entry by denying such interconnection or by setting terms, conditions, and rates that could undermine the ability of the new entrants to compete.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-10""><a href=""#cite_note-10"">[10]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Intercarrier compensation.</b> Under these conditions, many calls will arise between parties on different networks. While it might be possible to have the calling party pay its carrier and the called party pay its carrier, for various reasons it has been traditional in the United States for the calling party's carrier to pay the called party's carrier for completing the call — this is called intercarrier compensation—and, in turn, recover those costs in the rates charged to its subscribers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11"">[11]</a></sup> The 1996 Act requires that intercarrier compensation rates among competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) be based on the ""additional costs of terminating such calls"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-12""><a href=""#cite_note-12"">[12]</a></sup> However, the framework created by the 1996 Act set different intercarrier compensation rates for services that were not competing at that time but do compete today.
</p>, <p><b>RBOCs may enter long distance.</b> To foster competition in both the long-distance and local markets, the 1996 Act created a process by which the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Companies"" title=""Regional Bell Operating Companies"">Regional Bell Operating Companies</a> (""RBOCs"") would be free to offer long-distance service (which was not permitted under one of the terms of the 1982 Modified Final Judgement settling the government's antitrust case against the former Bell System monopoly)<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup> once they made a showing that their local markets had been opened up to competition.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup> The list of Bell Operating Companies in the bill are: Bell Telephone Company of Nevada, Illinois Bell Telephone Company, Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated, Michigan Bell Telephone Company, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, New Jersey Bell Telephone Company, New York Telephone Company, U S West Communications Company, South Central Bell Telephone Company, Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia, The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia, The Diamond State Telephone Company, The Ohio Bell Telephone Company, The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, or Wisconsin Telephone Company.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Wholesale access to incumbents' networks.</b> To allow new entrants enough time to fully build out their own networks, the Act requires the incumbent local exchange carriers to make available to entrants, at cost-based wholesale rates, those elements of their network to which entrants needed access in order not to be impaired in their ability to offer telecommunications services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Universal service support made explicit.</b> Prior to enactment of the Act, <a href=""/wiki/Universal_service"" title=""Universal service"">universal service</a> had been funded through <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=Implicit_subsidies&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Implicit subsidies (page does not exist)"">implicit subsidies</a>, levied as above-cost business rates, urban rates, and above-cost rates for the ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Access_charge"" title=""Access charge"">access charges</a>"" that long-distance carriers paid as intercarrier compensation to local telephone companies for originating and terminating their subscribers' long-distance calls. Recognizing that new entrants would target those services that had above-cost rates, and thus erode universal service support, Congress included in the 1996 Act a provision requiring universal service support to be explicit, rather than hidden in above-cost rates.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-:0_17-0""><a href=""#cite_note-:0-17"">[17]</a></sup> This requirement has only been partially implemented, however, and therefore significant implicit universal services subsidies still remain in above-cost rates for certain services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The regulatory framework created by the 1996 Act was intended to foster ""intramodal"" competition within distinct markets, i.e., among companies that used the same underlying technology to provide service.  For example, competition was envisioned between the incumbent local and long-distance wireline carriers plus new competitive local exchange carriers, all of which used circuit-switched networks to offer voice services.
</p>, <p>It did not envision the intermodal competition that has subsequently developed, such as wireless service competing with both local and long-distance wireline service, VoIP competing with wireline and wireless telephony, IP video competing with cable television. Providers from separate regulatory regimes have been brought into competition with one another as a result of subsequent deployment of digital broadband technologies in telephone and cable networks.  Voice and video services can now be provided using Internet protocol and thus might be classified as unregulated information services, but these services compete directly with regulated traditional voice and video services.  Moreover, these digital technologies do not recognize national borders, much less state boundaries.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-digital.library.unt.edu_19-0""><a href=""#cite_note-digital.library.unt.edu-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Given the focus on intramodal competition and the lack of intermodal competition, there was little concern about statutory or regulatory language that set different regulatory burdens for different technology modes. As a result, the current statutory and regulatory framework may be inconsistent with, or unresponsive to, current market conditions in several ways:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-20""><a href=""#cite_note-20"">[20]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Generally speaking, the number of broadband networks is limited by cost constraint up-front, fixed costs—which do not apply to applications providers.  In this new environment, there will be three broad categories of competition:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-digital.library.unt.edu_19-1""><a href=""#cite_note-digital.library.unt.edu-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>These three areas of competition will all be affected by a common factor: will there be entry by a third broadband network to compete with the broadband networks of the local telephone company and the local cable operator?
</p>, <p>There are four general approaches to the regulation of broadband network providers vis-a-vis independent applications providers (At present, the FCC follows the last two approaches):
</p>, <p>There is consensus<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-21""><a href=""#cite_note-21"">[21]</a></sup> that the current universal service and intercarrier compensation mechanisms need to be modified to accommodate the new market conditions.  For example, the current universal service funding mechanism is assessed only on telecommunications services, and carriers can receive universal service funding only in support of telecommunications services.  Thus, if services that had been classified as telecommunications services are re-classified as information services, as recently occurred for high-speed digital subscriber line (""DSL"") services, then the universal service assessment base will decline and carriers that depend on universal service funding may see a decline in support.  It therefore may be timely to consider whether the scope of universal service should be expanded to include universal access to a broadband network at affordable rates, not just to basic telephone service.
</p>, <p>The 1996 Telecommunications Act is divided into seven Titles:
</p>, <p><b>Title I</b>, ""Telecommunications Service"": Helps to outline the general duties of the telecommunication carriers as well as the obligations of all <a href=""/wiki/Local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Local exchange carrier"">local exchange carriers</a> (LECs) and the additional obligations of <a href=""/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Incumbent local exchange carrier"">incumbent local exchange carriers</a> (ILECs).
</p>, <p><b>Title II</b>, ""Broadcast Services"": Outlines the granting and licensing of broadcast spectrum by the government, including a provision to issue licenses to current television stations to commence <a href=""/wiki/Digital_television"" title=""Digital television"">digital television</a> broadcasting, the use of the revenues generated by such licensing, the terms of broadcast licenses, the process of renewing <a href=""/wiki/Broadcast_license"" title=""Broadcast license"">broadcast licenses</a>, direct broadcast satellite services, automated ship distress and safety systems, and restrictions on over-the-air reception devices
</p>, <p><b>Title III</b>, ""Cable Services"": Outlines the <a href=""/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984"" title=""Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984"">Cable Act</a> reform, cable services provided by telephone companies, the preemption of franchising authority regulation of telecommunication services, VHS home video programming accessibility, and competitive availability of navigation devices.
</p>, <p><b>Title IV</b>, ""Regulatory Reform"": Outlines regulatory forbearance, a biennial review of regulations, regulatory relief, and the elimination of unnecessary Commission regulations and functions.
</p>, <p><b>Title V</b>, ""Obscenity and Violence"": <style data-mw-deduplicate=""TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}</style></p>, <p>Outlines regulations regarding obscene programming on <a href=""/wiki/Cable_television"" title=""Cable television"">cable television</a>, the scrambling of cable channels for nonsubscribers, the scrambling of sexually explicit adult video service programming, the cable operators' refusal to carry certain programs, coercion and enticement of minors, and online family empowerment, including a requirement for the manufacture of televisions that block programs using <a href=""/wiki/V-chip"" title=""V-chip"">V-chip</a> technology.  Title V also gives a clarification of the current laws regarding communication of obscene materials through the use of a computer.
</p>, <p><b>Title VI</b>, ""Effect on Other Laws"" : Outlines the applicability of <a href=""/wiki/Consent_decree"" title=""Consent decree"">consent decrees</a> and other laws and the preemption of local taxation with respect to direct-to-home sales.
</p>, <p><b>Title VII</b>, ""Miscellaneous Provisions"" : Outlines provisions relating to the prevention of unfair billing practices for information or services provided over toll-free telephone calls, privacy of consumer information, pole attachments, facilities siting, radio frequency emission standards, mobile services direct access to long-distance carriers, advanced telecommunications incentives, the telecommunications development fund, the National Education Technology Funding Corporation, a report on the use of advance telecommunications services for medical purposes, and outlines the authorization of appropriations.
</p>, <p>The Act makes a significant distinction between providers of telecommunications services and information services.  The term 'telecommunications service' means the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.'  On the other hand, the term 'information service' means the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic publishing, but does not include any use of any such capability for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service.  The distinction becomes particularly important when a carrier provides information services, because the Act enforces specific regulations against 'telecommunications carriers' but not against providers of information services.  By one interpretation of the Act, a carrier providing information services is not a 'telecommunications carrier'.  For example, under this interpretation a carrier would not be a 'telecommunications carrier' when it is selling broadband Internet access.  With the convergence of telephone, cable, and internet providers, this distinction has created much controversy.  Under <a href=""/wiki/National_Cable_%26_Telecommunications_Ass%27n_v._Brand_X_Internet_Services"" title=""National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services"">BrandX</a>, the Supreme Court applied the doctrine of Chevron deference and thereby allowed the question of how to interpret the Act's ambiguous language to be decided by the FCC.
</p>, <p>The Act both deregulated and created new regulations. Congress forced local telephone companies to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forced-access"" title=""Forced-access"">share their lines with competitors</a> at regulated rates if ""the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer"" (Section 251(3)(2)(B)). This led to the creation of a new group of telephone companies, ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Competitive_Local_Exchange_Carrier"" title=""Competitive Local Exchange Carrier"">Competitive Local Exchange Carriers</a>"" (CLECs), that compete with ""ILECs"" or <a href=""/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier"" title=""Incumbent local exchange carrier"">incumbent local exchange carriers</a>.
</p>, <p>Most media ownership regulations were eased, and the cap on radio station ownership was eliminated.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-23""><a href=""#cite_note-23"">[23]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Title V of the 1996 Act is the <a href=""/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act"" title=""Communications Decency Act"">Communications Decency Act</a>, aimed at regulating <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a> indecency and obscenity, but was ruled unconstitutional by the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court"" title=""U.S. Supreme Court"">U.S. Supreme Court</a> for violating the <a href=""/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" title=""First Amendment to the United States Constitution"">First Amendment</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-24""><a href=""#cite_note-24"">[24]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-25""><a href=""#cite_note-25"">[25]</a></sup> Portions of Title V remain, including the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Good_Samaritan_Act"" title=""Good Samaritan Act"">Good Samaritan Act</a>, which protects ISPs from liability for third-party content on their services, and legal definitions of the Internet.
</p>, <p>The Act codified the concept of <a href=""/wiki/Universal_service"" title=""Universal service"">universal service</a> and led to creation of the <a href=""/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund"" title=""Universal Service Fund"">Universal Service Fund</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/E-rate"" title=""E-rate"">E-rate</a>. The Act employs the following <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Terms_of_art"" title=""Terms of art"">terms of art</a>: ""Information service"" which is defined as:
</p>, <p>The offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available 
information via telecommunications</p>, <p>When the smaller CLECs faced financial problems, the trend toward competition slowed, turning into a decade of reconsolidation. [Marcus] The two largest CLECs, Teleport Communications Group (TCG) and <a href=""/wiki/Metropolitan_Fiber_Systems"" title=""Metropolitan Fiber Systems"">Metropolitan Fiber Systems</a> (MFS) were acquired by <a href=""/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation"" title=""AT&amp;T Corporation"">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href=""/wiki/MCI_Communications"" title=""MCI Communications"">MCI</a>/WorldCom.
</p>, <p>Looking back five years after the bill was passed, the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Consumers_Union"" title=""Consumers Union"">Consumers Union</a> reported that wire to wire competition, the reason that sold the bill, had not succeeded as legislators had hoped. CLECs had captured just under seven percent of total lines in the country, and only three percent of homes and small businesses. Wire to wire competition accounted for only one percent of total lines nationwide.
</p>, <p>The Consumers Union also raises one other major point. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not foster competition among ILECs as the bill had hoped. Instead, of ILECs encroaching on each other, the opposite occurred  –  mergers. Before the 1996 Act was passed, the largest four ILECs owned less than half of all the lines in the country while, five years later, the largest four local telephone companies owned about 85% of all the lines in the country.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-26""><a href=""#cite_note-26"">[26]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Robert_Crandall"" title=""Robert Crandall"">Robert Crandall</a> has argued that the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Forced-access"" title=""Forced-access"">forced-access</a> provisions of the 1996 Act have had little economic value, and that the primary, sustainable competitive forces in phone and related, non-'radio', telecommunications are the wireline telephone companies, the cable companies, and the wireless companies.
</p>, <p>The Act was claimed to foster competition. Instead, it continued the historic industry consolidation reducing the number of major media companies from around 50 in 1983 to 10 in 1996<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-27""><a href=""#cite_note-27"">[27]</a></sup> and 6 in 2005.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-28""><a href=""#cite_note-28"">[28]</a></sup> An FCC study found that the Act had led to a drastic decline in the number of radio station owners, even as the actual number of commercial stations in the United States had increased.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-29""><a href=""#cite_note-29"">[29]</a></sup> This decline in owners and increase in stations has reportedly had the effect of <a href=""/wiki/Radio_homogenization"" title=""Radio homogenization"">Radio homogenization</a>, where programming has become similar across formats.
</p>, <p>Consumer activist <a href=""/wiki/Ralph_Nader"" title=""Ralph Nader"">Ralph Nader</a> argued that the Act was an example of <a href=""/wiki/Corporate_welfare"" title=""Corporate welfare"">corporate welfare</a> spawned by political corruption, because it gave away to incumbent broadcasters valuable licenses for broadcasting digital signals on the public airwaves.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-30""><a href=""#cite_note-30"">[30]</a></sup> There was a requirement in the Act that the FCC not auction off the public spectrum which the FCC itself valued at $11–$70 billion.
</p>, <p>It had been specifically named in the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace"" title=""Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"">Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a> as an act ""which repudiates your own [i.e. American] Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-31""><a href=""#cite_note-31"">[31]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In later years, criticism of the Telecommunications Act continued. One commentator, Warren J.

He described this provision as ""blatantly unconstitutional"" and noted that the balance of the Act would ""shape our future"" by eliminating ""barriers between the industry's segments, e.g., local and long-distance services, broadcast and cable television, etc.""

There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example <a href=""/wiki/Antarctica"" title=""Antarctica"">Antarctica</a>, plus large regions of <a href=""/wiki/Australia"" title=""Australia"">Australia</a>, <a href=""/wiki/South_America"" title=""South America"">South America</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Africa"" title=""Africa"">Africa</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Northern_Canada"" title=""Northern Canada"">Northern Canada</a>, <a href=""/wiki/China"" title=""China"">China</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Russia"" title=""Russia"">Russia</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Greenland"" title=""Greenland"">Greenland</a>.
</p>, <p>After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_phone"" title=""Satellite phone"">mobile satellite phones</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_radio"" title=""Satellite radio"">satellite radio</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_television"" title=""Satellite television"">satellite television</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access"" title=""Satellite Internet access"">satellite Internet access</a>. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial <a href=""/wiki/Transponder_(satellite_communications)"" title=""Transponder (satellite communications)"">satellite transponder channels</a> continued to drop significantly.
</p>, <p>On 11 September 1940, <a href=""/wiki/George_Stibitz"" title=""George Stibitz"">George Stibitz</a> was able to transmit problems using <a href=""/wiki/Teleprinter"" title=""Teleprinter"">teleprinter</a> to his Complex Number Calculator in New York and receive the computed results back at <a href=""/wiki/Dartmouth_College"" title=""Dartmouth College"">Dartmouth College</a> in <a href=""/wiki/New_Hampshire"" title=""New Hampshire"">New Hampshire</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup> This configuration of a centralized computer or <a href=""/wiki/Mainframe_computer"" title=""Mainframe computer"">mainframe computer</a> with remote ""dumb terminals"" remained popular throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate <a href=""/wiki/Packet_switching"" title=""Packet switching"">packet switching</a> — a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969. This network soon became the <a href=""/wiki/ARPANET"" title=""ARPANET"">ARPANET</a>, which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>ARPANET's development centered around the Request for Comment process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of the <a href=""/wiki/Communication_protocol"" title=""Communication protocol"">communication protocols</a> that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_Protocol"" title=""Internet Protocol"">Internet Protocol</a> version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"" title=""Transmission Control Protocol"">Transmission Control Protocol</a> (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.
</p>, <p>Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and <a href=""/wiki/Computer_network"" title=""Computer network"">computer networking</a> because it is flexible and can be bundled into cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few <a href=""/wiki/Optical_communications_repeater"" title=""Optical communications repeater"">repeaters</a>.
</p>, <p>In 1966 <a href=""/wiki/Charles_K._Kao"" title=""Charles K. Kao"">Charles K. Kao</a> and <a href=""/wiki/George_Hockham"" title=""George Hockham"">George Hockham</a> proposed optical fibers at STC Laboratories (STL) at <a href=""/wiki/Harlow"" title=""Harlow"">Harlow</a>, England, when they showed that the losses of 1000 dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5-10 dB/km in coaxial cable) was due to contaminants, which could potentially be removed.
</p>, <p>Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Corning_Glass_Works"" title=""Corning Glass Works"">Corning Glass Works</a>, with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20<a href=""/wiki/Decibel"" title=""Decibel"">dB</a>/km), and at the same time GaAs (Gallium arsenide) <a href=""/wiki/Laser_diode"" title=""Laser diode"">semiconductor lasers</a> were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.
</p>, <p>After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic communications system was developed, which operated at a wavelength around 0.8 µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Mbps"" title=""Mbps"">Mbps</a> with repeater spacing of up to 10 km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.
</p>, <p>The first wide area network fibre optic cable system in the world seems to have been installed by Rediffusion in Hastings, East Sussex, UK in 1978. The cables were placed in ducting throughout the town, and had over 1000 subscribers. They were used at that time for the transmission of television channels, not available because of local reception problems.
</p>, <p>The first <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Transatlantic_telephone_cable"" title=""Transatlantic telephone cable"">transatlantic telephone cable</a> to use optical fiber was <a href=""/wiki/TAT-8"" title=""TAT-8"">TAT-8</a>, based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988.
</p>, <p>In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a>, and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as <a href=""/wiki/Video_on_demand"" title=""Video on demand"">video on demand</a>. <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Internet_protocol"" title=""Internet protocol"">Internet protocol</a> data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Moore%27s_Law"" title=""Moore's Law"">Moore's Law</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>

The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary.  These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.
</p>, <p>The plant facilities can be delivered via underground facilities, either direct buried or through conduit or in some cases laid under water, via aerial facilities such as telephone or power poles, or via microwave radio signals for long distances where either of the other two methods is too costly.

"[<p>In <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a>, a <b>point-to-point</b> connection refers to a communications connection between two <a href=""/wiki/Communication_endpoint"" title=""Communication endpoint"">communication endpoints</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Node_(networking)"" title=""Node (networking)"">nodes</a>.  An example is a <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_call"" title=""Telephone call"">telephone call</a>, in which one telephone is connected with one other, and what is said by one caller can only be heard by the other.  This is contrasted with a <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Point-to-multipoint"" title=""Point-to-multipoint"">point-to-multipoint</a></i> or  <i><a href=""/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)"" title=""Broadcasting (networking)"">broadcast</a></i> connection, in which many nodes can receive information transmitted by one node.

</p>, <p>The term is also used in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Computer_networking"" title=""Computer networking"">computer networking</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Computer_architecture"" title=""Computer architecture"">computer architecture</a> to refer to a wire or other connection that links only two computers or circuits, as opposed to other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Network_topologies"" title=""Network topologies"">network topologies</a> such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Computer_bus"" title=""Computer bus"">buses</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Crossbar_switch"" title=""Crossbar switch"">crossbar switches</a> which can connect many communications devices. 
</p>, <p><i>Point-to-point</i> is sometimes abbreviated as <i><a class=""mw-redirect mw-disambig"" href=""/wiki/P2P_(disambiguation)"" title=""P2P (disambiguation)"">P2P</a></i>. This usage of <i>P2P</i> is distinct from <i>P2P</i> meaning <i><a href=""/wiki/Peer-to-peer"" title=""Peer-to-peer"">peer-to-peer</a></i> in the context of <a href=""/wiki/File_sharing"" title=""File sharing"">file sharing</a> networks or other data-sharing protocols between peers.
</p>, <p>A traditional point-to-point data link is a communications medium with exactly two endpoints and no data or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Packet_(information_technology)"" title=""Packet (information technology)"">packet</a> formatting. The host computers at either end take full responsibility for formatting the data transmitted between them. The connection between the computer and the communications medium was generally implemented through an <a href=""/wiki/RS-232"" title=""RS-232"">RS-232</a> or similar interface. Computers in close proximity may be connected by wires directly between their interface cards.
</p>, <p>When connected at a distance, each endpoint would be fitted with a <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modem</a> to convert analog telecommunications signals into a digital data stream. When the connection uses a telecommunications provider, the connection is called a <a href=""/wiki/Dedicated_line"" title=""Dedicated line"">dedicated</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Leased_line"" title=""Leased line"">leased</a>, or <a href=""/wiki/Private_line"" title=""Private line"">private line</a>. The <a href=""/wiki/ARPANET"" title=""ARPANET"">ARPANET</a> used leased lines to provide point-to-point data links between its <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Packet-switching"" title=""Packet-switching"">packet-switching</a> nodes, which were called <a href=""/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor"" title=""Interface Message Processor"">Interface Message Processors</a>.
</p>, <p>In modern computer networking, the term point-to-point telecommunications means a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Wireless_networking"" title=""Wireless networking"">wireless</a> data link between two fixed points. The telecommunications signal is typically bi-directional and either <i><a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access"" title=""Time-division multiple access"">time-division multiple access</a></i> (TDMA) or <a href=""/wiki/Channelization_(telecommunications)"" title=""Channelization (telecommunications)"">channelized</a>. This can be a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Microwave_relay"" title=""Microwave relay"">microwave relay</a> link consisting of a transmitter which transmits a narrow beam of microwaves with a <a href=""/wiki/Parabolic_antenna"" title=""Parabolic antenna"">parabolic dish</a> antenna to a second parabolic dish at the receiver.  It also includes technologies such as <a href=""/wiki/Laser"" title=""Laser"">lasers</a> which transmit data modulated on a light beam.  These technologies require an unobstructed <a href=""/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation"" title=""Line-of-sight propagation"">line of sight</a> between the two points and thus are limited by the visual horizon to distances of about 40 miles (64 km).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[a]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Local_network"" title=""Local network"">local network</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Repeater_hub"" title=""Repeater hub"">repeater hubs</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Network_switch"" title=""Network switch"">switches</a> provide basic connectivity. A hub provides a point-to-multipoint (or simply multipoint) circuit in which all connected client nodes share the network bandwidth. A switch on the other hand provides a series of point-to-point circuits, via microsegmentation, which allows each client node to have a dedicated circuit and the added advantage of having <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Full-duplex"" title=""Full-duplex"">full-duplex</a> connections.
</p>, <p>From the <a href=""/wiki/OSI_model"" title=""OSI model"">OSI model</a>'s layer perspective, both switches and repeater hubs provide point-to-point connections on the <a href=""/wiki/Physical_layer"" title=""Physical layer"">physical layer</a>. However, on the <a href=""/wiki/Data_link_layer"" title=""Data link layer"">data link layer</a>, a repeater hub provides point-to-multipoint connectivity – each <a href=""/wiki/Frame_(networking)"" title=""Frame (networking)"">frame</a> is forwarded to all nodes – while a switch provides virtual point-to-point connections – each <a href=""/wiki/Unicast"" title=""Unicast"">unicast</a> frame is only forwarded to the destination node.
</p>, <p>Within many <a href=""/wiki/Circuit_switching"" title=""Circuit switching"">switched telecommunications systems</a>, it is possible to establish a permanent circuit. One example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building, which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher. ""Nailing down"" a switched connection saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points.

</p>, <p>The term gateway can also loosely refer to a computer or computer program configured to perform the tasks of a gateway, such as a <a href=""/wiki/Default_gateway"" title=""Default gateway"">default gateway</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Router_(computing)"" title=""Router (computing)"">router</a>, and in the case of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HTTP"" title=""HTTP"">HTTP</a>, gateway is also often used as a synonym for <a href=""/wiki/Reverse_proxy"" title=""Reverse proxy"">reverse proxy</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>A network gateway provides interoperability between networks and contains devices, such as protocol translators, <a href=""/wiki/Impedance_matching"" title=""Impedance matching"">impedance matchers</a>, rate converters, <a href=""/wiki/Fault_(technology)"" title=""Fault (technology)"">fault</a> isolators, or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Signalling_(telecommunications)"" title=""Signalling (telecommunications)"">signal</a> translators. A network gateway requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between the networks using the gateway. Network gateways, known as protocol translation gateways or mapping gateways, can perform protocol conversions to connect networks with different network protocol technologies. For example, a network gateway connects an office or home <a href=""/wiki/Intranet"" title=""Intranet"">intranet</a> to the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a>. If an office or home computer user wants to load a <a href=""/wiki/Web_page"" title=""Web page"">web page</a>, at least two network gateways are accessed—one to get from the office or home network to the Internet and one to get from the Internet to the computer that serves the web page.

</p>, <p>During this period, the World Bank and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ITU"" title=""ITU"">ITU</a> had advised the Indian Government to liberalise long-distance services to release the monopoly of the state-owned DoT and VSNL and to enable competition in the long-distance carrier business which would help reduce tariff's and better the economy of the country. The Rao run government instead liberalised the local services, taking the opposite political parties into confidence and assuring foreign involvement in the long-distance business after 5 years. The country was divided into 20 telecommunication circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services. These circles were divided into category A, B and C depending on the value of the revenue in each circle. The government threw open the bids to one private company per circle along with government-owned DoT per circle. For cellular service two service providers were allowed per circle and a 15 years licence was given to each provider. During all these improvements, the government did face oppositions from <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Indian_Telephone_Industries"" title=""Indian Telephone Industries"">ITI</a>, DoT, MTNL, VSNL and other labour unions, but they managed to keep away from all the hurdles.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Dash_20-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Dash-20"">[20]</a></sup>

Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-27""><a href=""#cite_note-27"">[27]</a></sup> The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as <i>Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS)</i> which was later named as <a href=""/wiki/Bharat_Sanchar_Nigam_Limited"" title=""Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited"">Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited</a> (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted the government to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises.

</p>, <p>This was a gateway to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian telecom markets. After March 2000, the government became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators. The government further reduced licence fees for [cellular service providers and increased the allowable stake to 74% for foreign companies. Because of all these factors, the service fees finally reduced and the call costs were cut greatly enabling every common middle-class family in India to afford a cell phone.

</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/LIRNEasia"" title=""LIRNEasia"">LIRNEasia</a>'s Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index, which summarises stakeholders' perception on certain TRE dimensions, provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) anti-competitive practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.
</p>, <p>The results for India, point out to the fact that the stakeholders perceive the TRE to be most conducive for the mobile sector followed by fixed and then broadband. Other than for Access to ScarceResources the fixed sector lags behind the mobile sector. The fixed and mobile sectors have the highest scores for Tariff Regulation. Market entry also scores well for the mobile sector
as competition is well entrenched with most of the circles with 4–5 mobile service providers. The broadband sector has the lowest score in the aggregate. The low penetration of broadband of mere 3.87 against the policy objective of 9 million at the end of 2007 clearly indicates that the regulatory environment is not very conducive.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lirneasia_tre_86-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lirneasia_tre-86"">[86]</a></sup>

"[<p>A <b>duplex</b> <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Communication_system"" title=""Communication system"">communication system</a> is a <a href=""/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)"" title=""Point-to-point (telecommunications)"">point-to-point</a> system composed of two or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. Duplex systems are employed in many communications networks, either to allow for simultaneous communication in both directions between two connected parties or to provide a reverse path for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. There are two types of duplex communication systems: full-duplex (FDX) and half-duplex (HDX).
</p>, <p>In a <b>full-duplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other simultaneously.  An example of a full-duplex device is <a href=""/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service"" title=""Plain old telephone service"">plain old telephone service</a>; the parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party. There is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly speaking, there are two communication channels between them.
</p>, <p>In a <b>half-duplex</b>  or <b>semiduplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An example of a half-duplex device is a <a href=""/wiki/Walkie-talkie"" title=""Walkie-talkie"">walkie-talkie</a>, a <a href=""/wiki/Two-way_radio"" title=""Two-way radio"">two-way radio</a> that has a <a href=""/wiki/Push-to-talk"" title=""Push-to-talk"">push-to-talk</a> button. When the local user wants to speak to the remote person, they push this button, which turns on the transmitter and turns off the receiver, preventing them from hearing the remote person while talking. To listen to the remote person, they release the button, which turns on the receiver and turns off the transmitter.
</p>, <p>Systems that do not need duplex capability may instead use <a href=""/wiki/Simplex_communication"" title=""Simplex communication"">simplex communication</a>, in which one device transmits and the others can only listen.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup> Examples are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Broadcast"" title=""Broadcast"">broadcast</a> radio and television, <a href=""/wiki/Garage_door_opener"" title=""Garage door opener"">garage door openers</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Baby_monitor"" title=""Baby monitor"">baby monitors</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Wireless_microphone"" title=""Wireless microphone"">wireless microphones</a>, and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Surveillance_camera"" title=""Surveillance camera"">surveillance cameras</a>. In these devices, the communication is only in one direction.
</p>, <p>A <i>half-duplex</i> (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmission to complete, before replying.
</p>, <p>An example of a half-duplex system is a two-party system such as a <a href=""/wiki/Walkie-talkie"" title=""Walkie-talkie"">walkie-talkie</a>, wherein one must use ""over"" or another previously designated keyword to indicate the end of transmission and ensure that only one party transmits at a time. An analogy for a half-duplex system would be a one-lane section of road with traffic controllers at each end. Traffic can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time, regulated by the traffic controllers.
</p>, <p>Half-duplex systems are usually used to conserve <a href=""/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" title=""Bandwidth (signal processing)"">bandwidth</a>, at the cost of reducing the overall bidirectional throughput, since only a single <a href=""/wiki/Communication_channel"" title=""Communication channel"">communication channel</a> is needed and is shared alternately between the two directions. For example, a walkie-talkie or a DECT phone or so-called TDD 4G or 5G phones requires only a single <a href=""/wiki/Frequency"" title=""Frequency"">frequency</a> for bidirectional communication, while a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cell_phone"" title=""Cell phone"">cell phone</a> in the so-called FDD mode, is a full-duplex device, and generally requires two frequencies to carry the two simultaneous voice channels, one in each direction.
</p>, <p>In automatic communications systems such as two-way data-links, <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> can be used for time allocations for communications in a half-duplex system. For example, station A on one end of the data link could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, then station B on the other end could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, and then the cycle repeats. In this scheme, the channel is never left idle. 
</p>, <p>In half-duplex systems, if more than one party transmits at the same time, a <a href=""/wiki/Collision_(telecommunications)"" title=""Collision (telecommunications)"">collision</a> occurs, resulting in lost or distorted messages.
</p>, <p>A <i>full-duplex</i> (FDX) system allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-2""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Land-line <a href=""/wiki/Telephone"" title=""Telephone"">telephone</a> networks are full-duplex since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time. Full-duplex operation is achieved on a <a href=""/wiki/Two-wire_circuit"" title=""Two-wire circuit"">two-wire circuit</a> through the use of a <a href=""/wiki/Hybrid_coil"" title=""Hybrid coil"">hybrid coil</a> in a <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_hybrid"" title=""Telephone hybrid"">telephone hybrid</a>. Modern cell phones are also full-duplex.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There is a technical distinction between full-duplex communication, using a single physical communication channel for both directions simultaneously and <b>dual-simplex</b> communication that uses two distinct channels, one for each direction. From the user perspective, the technical difference doesn't matter and both variants are commonly referred to as <i>full duplex</i>.
</p>, <p>Many <a href=""/wiki/Ethernet"" title=""Ethernet"">Ethernet</a> connections achieve full-duplex operation by making simultaneous use of two physical <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">twisted pairs</a> inside the same jacket, or two optical fibers which are directly connected to each networked device: one pair or fiber is for receiving packets, while the other is for sending packets. Other Ethernet variants, such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/1000BASE-T"" title=""1000BASE-T"">1000BASE-T</a> use the same channels in each direction simultaneously. In any case, with full-duplex operation, the cable itself becomes a collision-free environment and doubles the maximum total transmission capacity supported by each Ethernet connection.
</p>, <p>Full-duplex has also several benefits over the use of half-duplex. Since there is only one transmitter on each twisted pair there is no contention and no collisions so time is not wasted by having to wait or retransmit frames. Full transmission capacity is available in both directions because the send and receive functions are separate.
</p>, <p>Some computer-based systems of the 1960s and 1970s required full-duplex facilities, even for half-duplex operation, since their poll-and-response schemes could not tolerate the slight delays in reversing the direction of transmission in a half-duplex line.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)"">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>, <p>Full-duplex audio systems like telephones can create echo, which is distracting to users and impedes the performance of modems. Echo occurs when the sound originating from the far end comes out of the speaker at the near end and re-enters the microphone<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[a]</a></sup> there and is then sent back to the far end. The sound then reappears at the original source end but delayed. 
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Echo_cancellation"" title=""Echo cancellation"">Echo cancellation</a> is a signal-processing operation that subtracts the far-end signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network. Echo cancellation is important technology allowing <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modems</a> to achieve good full-duplex performance. The V.32, V.34, V.56, and V.90 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ITU-T_V-Series_Recommendations"" title=""ITU-T V-Series Recommendations"">modem standards</a> require echo cancellation.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[3]</a></sup> Echo cancelers are available as both software and hardware implementations. They can be independent components in a communications system or integrated into the communication system's <a href=""/wiki/Central_processing_unit"" title=""Central processing unit"">central processing unit</a>.
</p>, <p>Where <a href=""/wiki/Channel_access_method"" title=""Channel access method"">channel access methods</a> are used in <a href=""/wiki/Point-to-multipoint_communication"" title=""Point-to-multipoint communication"">point-to-multipoint</a> networks (such as <a href=""/wiki/Cellular_network"" title=""Cellular network"">cellular networks</a>) for dividing forward and reverse communication channels on the same physical communications medium, they are known as duplexing methods.
</p>, <p><b>Time-division duplexing</b> (TDD) is the application of <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> to separate outward and return signals. It emulates full-duplex communication over a half-duplex communication link.
</p>, <p>Time-division duplexing is flexible in the case where there is <a href=""/wiki/Asymmetry"" title=""Asymmetry"">asymmetry</a> of the <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_link"" title=""Telecommunications link"">uplink</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Downlink"" title=""Downlink"">downlink</a> data rates or utilization. As the amount of uplink data increases, more communication capacity can be dynamically allocated, and as the traffic load becomes lighter, capacity can be taken away. The same applies in the downlink direction. 
</p>, <p>The <i>transmit/receive transition gap</i> (TTG) is the gap (time) between a downlink burst and the subsequent uplink burst. Similarly, the <i>receive/transmit transition gap</i> (RTG) is the gap between an uplink burst and the subsequent downlink burst.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Examples of time-division duplexing systems include:
</p>, <p><b>Frequency-division duplexing</b> (FDD) means that the <a href=""/wiki/Transmitter"" title=""Transmitter"">transmitter</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"" title=""Receiver (radio)"">receiver</a> operate using different <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_frequencies"" title=""Carrier frequencies"">carrier frequencies</a>. 
</p>, <p>The method is frequently used in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ham_radio"" title=""Ham radio"">ham radio</a> operation, where an operator is attempting to use a <a href=""/wiki/Repeater"" title=""Repeater"">repeater</a> station. The repeater station must be able to send and receive a transmission at the same time and does so by slightly altering the frequency at which it sends and receives.  This mode of operation is referred to as <i>duplex mode</i> or <i>offset mode</i>. Uplink and downlink sub-bands are said to be separated by the <i>frequency offset</i>. 
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplex systems can extend their range by using sets of simple repeater stations because the communications transmitted on any single frequency always travel in the same direction.
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplexing can be efficient in the case of symmetric traffic. In this case, time-division duplexing tends to waste bandwidth during the switch-over from transmitting to receiving, has greater inherent <a href=""/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"" title=""Latency (engineering)"">latency</a>, and may require more complex <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuitry"" title=""Circuitry"">circuitry</a>.
</p>, <p>Another advantage of frequency-division duplexing is that it makes radio planning easier and more efficient since base stations do not <i>hear</i> each other (as they transmit and receive in different sub-bands) and therefore will normally not interfere with each other. Conversely, with time-division duplexing systems, care must be taken to keep guard times between neighboring base stations (which decreases <a href=""/wiki/Spectral_efficiency"" title=""Spectral efficiency"">spectral efficiency</a>) or to synchronize base stations, so that they will transmit and receive at the same time (which increases network complexity and therefore cost, and reduces bandwidth allocation flexibility as all base stations and sectors will be forced to use the same uplink/downlink ratio).

Duplex systems are employed in many communications networks, either to allow for simultaneous communication in both directions between two connected parties or to provide a reverse path for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. There are two types of duplex communication systems: full-duplex (FDX) and half-duplex (HDX).
</p>, <p>In a <b>full-duplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other simultaneously.  An example of a full-duplex device is <a href=""/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service"" title=""Plain old telephone service"">plain old telephone service</a>; the parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party. There is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly speaking, there are two communication channels between them.
</p>, <p>In a <b>half-duplex</b>  or <b>semiduplex</b> system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time.

When the local user wants to speak to the remote person, they push this button, which turns on the transmitter and turns off the receiver, preventing them from hearing the remote person while talking. To listen to the remote person, they release the button, which turns on the receiver and turns off the transmitter.

In these devices, the communication is only in one direction.
</p>, <p>A <i>half-duplex</i> (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmission to complete, before replying.
</p>, <p>An example of a half-duplex system is a two-party system such as a <a href=""/wiki/Walkie-talkie"" title=""Walkie-talkie"">walkie-talkie</a>, wherein one must use ""over"" or another previously designated keyword to indicate the end of transmission and ensure that only one party transmits at a time. An analogy for a half-duplex system would be a one-lane section of road with traffic controllers at each end. Traffic can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time, regulated by the traffic controllers.
</p>, <p>Half-duplex systems are usually used to conserve <a href=""/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" title=""Bandwidth (signal processing)"">bandwidth</a>, at the cost of reducing the overall bidirectional throughput, since only a single <a href=""/wiki/Communication_channel"" title=""Communication channel"">communication channel</a> is needed and is shared alternately between the two directions. For example, a walkie-talkie or a DECT phone or so-called TDD 4G or 5G phones requires only a single <a href=""/wiki/Frequency"" title=""Frequency"">frequency</a> for bidirectional communication, while a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cell_phone"" title=""Cell phone"">cell phone</a> in the so-called FDD mode, is a full-duplex device, and generally requires two frequencies to carry the two simultaneous voice channels, one in each direction.
</p>, <p>In automatic communications systems such as two-way data-links, <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> can be used for time allocations for communications in a half-duplex system. For example, station A on one end of the data link could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, then station B on the other end could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, and then the cycle repeats. In this scheme, the channel is never left idle. 
</p>, <p>In half-duplex systems, if more than one party transmits at the same time, a <a href=""/wiki/Collision_(telecommunications)"" title=""Collision (telecommunications)"">collision</a> occurs, resulting in lost or distorted messages.
</p>, <p>A <i>full-duplex</i> (FDX) system allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lancaster_1-2""><a href=""#cite_note-lancaster-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Land-line <a href=""/wiki/Telephone"" title=""Telephone"">telephone</a> networks are full-duplex since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time. Full-duplex operation is achieved on a <a href=""/wiki/Two-wire_circuit"" title=""Two-wire circuit"">two-wire circuit</a> through the use of a <a href=""/wiki/Hybrid_coil"" title=""Hybrid coil"">hybrid coil</a> in a <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_hybrid"" title=""Telephone hybrid"">telephone hybrid</a>. Modern cell phones are also full-duplex.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There is a technical distinction between full-duplex communication, using a single physical communication channel for both directions simultaneously and <b>dual-simplex</b> communication that uses two distinct channels, one for each direction. From the user perspective, the technical difference doesn't matter and both variants are commonly referred to as <i>full duplex</i>.
</p>, <p>Many <a href=""/wiki/Ethernet"" title=""Ethernet"">Ethernet</a> connections achieve full-duplex operation by making simultaneous use of two physical <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">twisted pairs</a> inside the same jacket, or two optical fibers which are directly connected to each networked device: one pair or fiber is for receiving packets, while the other is for sending packets. Other Ethernet variants, such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/1000BASE-T"" title=""1000BASE-T"">1000BASE-T</a> use the same channels in each direction simultaneously. In any case, with full-duplex operation, the cable itself becomes a collision-free environment and doubles the maximum total transmission capacity supported by each Ethernet connection.
</p>, <p>Full-duplex has also several benefits over the use of half-duplex. Since there is only one transmitter on each twisted pair there is no contention and no collisions so time is not wasted by having to wait or retransmit frames. Full transmission capacity is available in both directions because the send and receive functions are separate.
</p>, <p>Some computer-based systems of the 1960s and 1970s required full-duplex facilities, even for half-duplex operation, since their poll-and-response schemes could not tolerate the slight delays in reversing the direction of transmission in a half-duplex line.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)"">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>, <p>Full-duplex audio systems like telephones can create echo, which is distracting to users and impedes the performance of modems. Echo occurs when the sound originating from the far end comes out of the speaker at the near end and re-enters the microphone<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[a]</a></sup> there and is then sent back to the far end. The sound then reappears at the original source end but delayed. 
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Echo_cancellation"" title=""Echo cancellation"">Echo cancellation</a> is a signal-processing operation that subtracts the far-end signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network. Echo cancellation is important technology allowing <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modems</a> to achieve good full-duplex performance. The V.32, V.34, V.56, and V.90 <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ITU-T_V-Series_Recommendations"" title=""ITU-T V-Series Recommendations"">modem standards</a> require echo cancellation.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[3]</a></sup> Echo cancelers are available as both software and hardware implementations. They can be independent components in a communications system or integrated into the communication system's <a href=""/wiki/Central_processing_unit"" title=""Central processing unit"">central processing unit</a>.
</p>, <p>Where <a href=""/wiki/Channel_access_method"" title=""Channel access method"">channel access methods</a> are used in <a href=""/wiki/Point-to-multipoint_communication"" title=""Point-to-multipoint communication"">point-to-multipoint</a> networks (such as <a href=""/wiki/Cellular_network"" title=""Cellular network"">cellular networks</a>) for dividing forward and reverse communication channels on the same physical communications medium, they are known as duplexing methods.
</p>, <p><b>Time-division duplexing</b> (TDD) is the application of <a href=""/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing"" title=""Time-division multiplexing"">time-division multiplexing</a> to separate outward and return signals. It emulates full-duplex communication over a half-duplex communication link.
</p>, <p>Time-division duplexing is flexible in the case where there is <a href=""/wiki/Asymmetry"" title=""Asymmetry"">asymmetry</a> of the <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_link"" title=""Telecommunications link"">uplink</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Downlink"" title=""Downlink"">downlink</a> data rates or utilization. As the amount of uplink data increases, more communication capacity can be dynamically allocated, and as the traffic load becomes lighter, capacity can be taken away. The same applies in the downlink direction. 
</p>, <p>The <i>transmit/receive transition gap</i> (TTG) is the gap (time) between a downlink burst and the subsequent uplink burst. Similarly, the <i>receive/transmit transition gap</i> (RTG) is the gap between an uplink burst and the subsequent downlink burst.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Examples of time-division duplexing systems include:
</p>, <p><b>Frequency-division duplexing</b> (FDD) means that the <a href=""/wiki/Transmitter"" title=""Transmitter"">transmitter</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"" title=""Receiver (radio)"">receiver</a> operate using different <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_frequencies"" title=""Carrier frequencies"">carrier frequencies</a>. 
</p>, <p>The method is frequently used in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ham_radio"" title=""Ham radio"">ham radio</a> operation, where an operator is attempting to use a <a href=""/wiki/Repeater"" title=""Repeater"">repeater</a> station. The repeater station must be able to send and receive a transmission at the same time and does so by slightly altering the frequency at which it sends and receives.  This mode of operation is referred to as <i>duplex mode</i> or <i>offset mode</i>. Uplink and downlink sub-bands are said to be separated by the <i>frequency offset</i>. 
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplex systems can extend their range by using sets of simple repeater stations because the communications transmitted on any single frequency always travel in the same direction.
</p>, <p>Frequency-division duplexing can be efficient in the case of symmetric traffic. In this case, time-division duplexing tends to waste bandwidth during the switch-over from transmitting to receiving, has greater inherent <a href=""/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"" title=""Latency (engineering)"">latency</a>, and may require more complex <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuitry"" title=""Circuitry"">circuitry</a>.
</p>, <p>Another advantage of frequency-division duplexing is that it makes radio planning easier and more efficient since base stations do not <i>hear</i> each other (as they transmit and receive in different sub-bands) and therefore will normally not interfere with each other. Conversely, with time-division duplexing systems, care must be taken to keep guard times between neighboring base stations (which decreases <a href=""/wiki/Spectral_efficiency"" title=""Spectral efficiency"">spectral efficiency</a>) or to synchronize base stations, so that they will transmit and receive at the same time (which increases network complexity and therefore cost, and reduces bandwidth allocation flexibility as all base stations and sectors will be forced to use the same uplink/downlink ratio).

"[<p><b>Telecommunications in the Philippines</b> are well-developed due to the presence of modern infrastructure facilities. The industry was <a href=""/wiki/Deregulation"" title=""Deregulation"">deregulated</a> in 1995 when President <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Fidel_Ramos"" title=""Fidel Ramos"">Fidel Ramos</a> signed Republic Act 7925 (The Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines). This law opened the sector to more private players and improved the provision of telecom services are better and fairer rates,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup> leading to the creation of many telecommunication service providers for mobile, fixed-line, Internet and other services.
</p>, <p>Two private companies offered telecom services namely Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company which is a subsidiary of <a href=""/wiki/Cable_%26_Wireless_plc"" title=""Cable &amp; Wireless plc"">Britain's Cable and Wireless</a>. The Spanish authorizes Eastern Extension to construct and operate the first submarine cable linking the Philippines and <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a>.
</p>, <p>The Philippine Islands Telephone and Telegraph Company is American-owned which started operations in 1905 in <a href=""/wiki/Metro_Manila"" title=""Metro Manila"">Metro Manila</a>. In 1928, merged with Cebu, Panay, and Negros Telephone and Telegraph companies to form the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Philippine_Long_Distance_Telephone_Company"" title=""Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company"">Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company</a> (PLDT). In 1932, the colonial Philippines congress granted PLDT a 50-year franchise to operate a national telephone system.
</p>, <p>The establishment of the Public Service Commission to regulate the industry as well as other utilities, meanwhile the Bureau of Posts was created to operate telegraph services nationwide.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 102"">: 102 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>Initially, PLDT was managed by Americans, including the American company <a href=""/wiki/GTE"" title=""GTE"">General Telephone and Electric Corporation</a> (GTE) as a major stockholder. However in March 1967, GTE disposed of their 28% controlling interest in PLDT. Which is why in November 7, 1967, the Philippines Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC) was registered to buy GTE's controlling interest. Ramon <a href=""/wiki/Cojuangco"" title=""Cojuangco"">Cojuangco</a>, who was part of one of the most influential clans in Philippine history, was a main incorporator. PTIC formally took control of PLDT on January 1, 1968. This led to the takeover of PLDT by the Filipinos, becoming a dominant player in telecommunications because of its authorization to operate a national network. Company officials however dispute that they were a monopoly because of the existence of a government telephone system, and over 60 provincial companies operating in the country. The Bureau of Telecommunications (Butel) handled the government telephone system, which by 1975 had 34,643 operational telephone lines, or about 10.2% of the total telephone capacity of the country.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 102–105"">: 102–105 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>There were also four major companies with license for international data communication.
</p>, <p>In 1976, the Philippine Association of Private Telephone Companies was organized to protect the interest of small telephone companies. By 1975, around 60 small telephone companies provided 11.7% of the total telephone capacity at the time. These small companies were dependent on PLDT to place inter-provincial and overseas calls, in which PLDT used this interconnection to their advantage.
</p>, <p>PLDT could allow, slow down, or deny interconnection at will. Some companies which found it financially impossible to operate without interconnection sold their companies to PLDT. They also dictated the interconnection access rates, which meant that PLDT cornered most telecommunications revenues. Eventually, by 1991, PLDT had 94% of the total lines.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 108–110"">: 108–110 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>Marcos' Presidential Decree 217 in 1973 mandated all PLDT subscribers to invest in PLDT to raise its equity and finance its expansion program. This law, known as the Subscribers Investment Plan (SIP) required all PLDT subscribers to buy non-voting shares in the company. Mandatory investors held about 85% of the total company equity shares but had no actual power in controlling the company.
</p>, <p>PLDT also had access to international loans from the <a href=""/wiki/World_Bank"" title=""World Bank"">World Bank</a>. These loans assisted PLDT's dominance, and PLDT became the single largest private recipient of foreign loans to the Philippines.
</p>, <p>In 1981, a National Telecommunications Development Plan was released. A section of the plan recommended the integration of all private telephone companies under one monopoly. Marcos issued a presidential directive to Retelco, PLDT's main competitor in Metro Manila, to merge with PLDT. The merger was met with objection by the owners of Retelco, but the merger was continued because Marcos threatened to withdraw the companies' franchises.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-3""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 110–113"">: 110–113 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>The <a href=""/wiki/Corazon_Aquino"" title=""Corazon Aquino"">Aquino</a> government's policy was two-pronged: it was to increase public spending in underserved or unserved municipalities, and allow entry of new players. In 1987, the DOTC adopted a series of policies aimed at rationalizing the development of the industry. This led to the reversal of Marcos' push towards the integration of the telecommunications system under a monopoly. It also affirmed that development of the national telcos needs an introduction of competition and regulated entry into the market. During the end of Cory’s term however, telecommunications was poor but PLDT prevailed with their tactics in maintaining their monopoly.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-4""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 119–123"">: 119–123 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>Under the Ramos administration, a coalition named the Movement for Reliable and Efficient Phone System (MORE Phones) was formed with the goal of liberalizing the telecommunications industry.  Until the mid-1990s, MORE Phones continued to pressure PLDT to be more transparent and accountable. <a href=""/wiki/Ricardo_Manapat"" title=""Ricardo Manapat"">Ricardo Manapat</a>, who wrote about the illegitimate activities of the Marcoses and their cronies, wrote a follow-up report entitled ""Wrong Number"" the PLDT Telephone Monopoly."" The report revealed PLDT's questionable management practices as well as how the Cojuangco family controlled the company, despite owning only 1.6% of the total stock.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-5""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 232–232"">: 232–232 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>As a countermeasure against PLDT's earlier attempts at refusing interconnection with its competitors, President Ramos signed an Executive Order 59 on 24 February 1993. EO 59 required interconnection among all authorized telecommunications companies, in order for subscribers on one operator to reach the subscribers of another. In the Senate, anti-monopoly bills were filed in the House of Representatives and it was reported that PLDT was the main target of these bills. The Congress had already approved nine telecom franchise, their applications pending at the NTC for provisional authority to operate international, cellular, or value-added services. This also led to the Congress controlling who could obtain a franchise. But PLDT would successfully block new entrants to the industry by filing various legal challenges.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-6""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 234–235"">: 234–235 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>In 1994, the NTC and several other industry players devised the Service Area Scheme (SAS) This scheme was in response to imbalanced demand of telecom companies in urban areas over rural areas.The SAS attempted to allow companies to earn profits but also ensure that part of those profits would be channeled to serve less profitable areas. Companies were allocated both profitable and unprofitable areas to ensure operational viability and the provision of rural telephony.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-7""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 242–245"">: 242–245 </span></sup>
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Globe_Telecom"" title=""Globe Telecom"">Globe Telecom</a> (Globe) was a joint venture between <a href=""/wiki/Ayala_Corporation"" title=""Ayala Corporation"">Ayala Corporation</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Singtel"" title=""Singtel"">Singapore Telecommunications Limited</a> (SingTel). Globe was the first foreign company to be granted entry into the Philippine’s liberalized market. In 1994, Globe launched its digital cellular services, pioneering the use of Global System for Mobile Communications Technology (<a href=""/wiki/GSM"" title=""GSM"">GSM</a>). In fact, Globe popularized the short messaging service (SMS) through adding it for free with their basic services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-8""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 263"">: 263 </span></sup>
</p>, <p>When the 1997 financial crisis stuck, there were two consolidations that happened in the industry. In June 2001, the Globe-Islacom Merger was completed. This merger resulted to providing improved services and a wider coverage for the two companies subscribers.
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Smart_Communications"" title=""Smart Communications"">Smart Communications</a> (Smart) was the first company to enter the liberalised market. In September 1999, PLDT purchased Smart Communications absorbing it as a 100-percent owned subsidiary.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> Smart was financially supported by <a href=""/wiki/First_Pacific"" title=""First Pacific"">First Pacific</a>. This partnership resulted to a rapid construction of Smart’s network and more importantly, the subsidization of handsets. Smart was also authorised to offer both international gateway and cellular telephone services. At the end of 2005, Smart became the largest cellular operator in the Philippines with over 15.4 million subscribers.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Salazar_2-9""><a href=""#cite_note-Salazar-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 264–265"">: 264–265 </span></sup>

</p>, <p>Considered one of the most profitable industries, telecoms have emerged in the country due to it becoming a necessity and its product life cycle.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup> The mobile market of the Philippines has been run by the duopoly of Smart together with Globe Telecom.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Stats_7-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Stats-7"">[7]</a></sup> The two companies have a very tight hold on the industry but they continue to fight for more subscribers and they are in a race to introduce new services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Stats_7-1""><a href=""#cite_note-Stats-7"">[7]</a></sup> However, both still lost subscribers during 2017 as the market went through consolidation.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Stats_7-2""><a href=""#cite_note-Stats-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Although based in the Philippines, there is foreign ownership in PLDT (76%) and Globe (73%)—resulting a duopoly in the telecom industry. Anthony Salim is one of them, which is the biggest controlling stockholder of PLDT through Hong Kong based First Pacific Company Limited, which led him to establish and expand in the Philippines as a conglomerate.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>It is expected that for the next five years to 2023, the growth of mobile subscribers will be low due to a highly mature and highly competitive market. There will be a movement from 4G to 5G services for faster browsing.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Stats_7-3""><a href=""#cite_note-Stats-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The mobile average revenue per user (ARPU) levels have been decreasing in the Philippines due to the visible competition in the mobile industry. In order to grab market share, aggressive price competition is done by these operators. There has been a drastic increase in mobile broadband penetration, as well as an increase of wireless broadband users over the past five years. It is predicted that over the next five years will have a strong growth. On the other hand, it could decline and slow down as the market matures. Currently, the Philippines is preparing from the move from <a href=""/wiki/4G"" title=""4G"">4G</a> to <a href=""/wiki/5G"" title=""5G"">5G</a>. A “5G technolab” is currently in the works in PLDT.

</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/SMS"" title=""SMS"">SMS</a> services are very common in the <a href=""/wiki/Philippines"" title=""Philippines"">Philippines</a>, from news briefs to multimedia services. Cellular mobile services began in the country only in 1991. In May 2000, the number of cellular phone subscribers exceeded the number of fixed line subscribers. This is because of the spotty telephone service and high cost of fixed line subscriptions. It was also seen how SMS is affordable. This led to the Philippines has become the global capital of text messaging, which was a feature of the mobile phone that was ignored by other countries. Meanwhile, in 2001, the popularity of the text messaging in the Philippines has created a subculture called <a href=""/wiki/SMS_language"" title=""SMS language"">Generation Txt</a>, where teenagers and young mobile professionals have developed their own language in text.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>(as of June 2021, incomplete)
</p>, <p>A lot of Filipinos work outside of their country and they keep contact with their families back home using calling cards to the Philippines because those are cheaper than direct calling. According to the TNS Digital Life Study of 2012, about 81% of urban Filipinos use the internet to keep in touch with their relatives abroad. 90% of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) belong to social media networking sites such as Facebook wherein they.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup> Some people use e-mail or <a href=""/wiki/Instant_messaging"" title=""Instant messaging"">instant messaging</a>, but the preferred method is still the phone.

</p>, <p>Eir operates a wholesale fixed-line network through its Open Eir unit, providing copper and fibre based access products to a wide range of Irish telecommunications companies. Its services include next generation access products, such as <a href=""/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#Fiber_to_the_premises"" title=""Fiber to the x"">FTTH</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#FTTN_and_FTTC"" title=""Fiber to the x"">FTTC</a> (VDSL) and legacy copper based services, including ADSL and classic digital circuit switched products like PSTN and ISDN. It also offers a range of legacy leased line services.
</p>, <p>The company's retail division markets these services directly to homes and businesses, and includes value added services like Eir TV and voice over broadband for home users and a wide range of digital services tailored to business customers.
</p>, <p>Eir operates a national mobile network both under its own Eir brand and <a href=""/wiki/GoMo"" title=""GoMo"">GoMo</a>, a value-focused, online-only sub-brand.

</p>, <p>In the third quarter of 2019, Eir accounted for 39% of the <a href=""/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"" title=""Republic of Ireland"">Republic of Ireland</a>'s fixed voice market retail revenue and 45.3% market share by fixed-line retail and wholesale revenue and 19.1% of the mobile market (excluding mobile broadband and machine-to-machine subscriptions) or 15.6% of total subscriptions. Eir had 31.4% of fixed broadband subscriptions (comprising FTTH, FTTC/VDSL and ADSL) and 42.7% of FTTP subscriptions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Its main fixed access infrastructure owning competitors are <a href=""/wiki/Virgin_Media_Ireland"" title=""Virgin Media Ireland"">Virgin Media Ireland</a> (which operates a <a href=""/wiki/Cable_television"" title=""Cable television"">cable TV</a> and broadband network) and <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=SIRO&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""SIRO (page does not exist)"">SIRO</a>, a joint venture between publicly owned energy supplier, <a href=""/wiki/ESB_Group"" title=""ESB Group"">ESB</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Vodafone_Ireland"" title=""Vodafone Ireland"">Vodafone</a>.

Eir also faces retail competition from Vodafone, <a href=""/wiki/Sky_Ireland"" title=""Sky Ireland"">Sky</a>, Digiweb and a large number of smaller ISPs using a mix wholesale access from Open Eir and SIRO to reach their customers.
</p>, <p>Eir also faces competition from mobile operators and MVNOs both for its own mobile services and also as fixed line replacement products. All mobile operators are capable of offering very competitive voice services and high speed 4G and increasingly 5G connectivity, which can often be faster than fixed services, particularly first generation NGA products using VDSL and fibre to cabinet, which can only offer a maximum of 100Mbit/s. ADSL services which are much slower again. 4G and 5G fixed-mobile services, using routers and external antennae have also become viable competitors in many rural and quasi rural areas. These offer ample and affordable data plans and very high speeds and a number of operators have designed products targeting homes and businesses using both existing mobile and dedicated LTE and 5G networks.
</p>, <p>Eir operates the largest fixed-line telecommunications network in the <a href=""/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"" title=""Republic of Ireland"">Republic of Ireland</a>, under licence from the <a href=""/wiki/Commission_for_Communications_Regulation"" title=""Commission for Communications Regulation"">Commission for Communications Regulation</a> (ComReg). Most homes and businesses in the state are dependent on their network. A range of telecommunications services is provided on the network including Business IP, its <a href=""/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching"" title=""Multiprotocol Label Switching"">MPLS</a> platform. Eir have also completed a wholly owned fibre network ring around <a href=""/wiki/Northern_Ireland"" title=""Northern Ireland"">Northern Ireland</a> and another around <a href=""/wiki/Belfast"" title=""Belfast"">Belfast</a>. Their ISP division, Eir Net, provides dial-up services, as well as broadband services (see broadband roll-out, below).  Any alarm-monitoring products using SMS are ""hardcoded"" to work with Eir's SMSC, so will not work on Digiweb, BT, Smart, UPC or Magnet phone networks. DECT SMS handsets are also preprogrammed for Eir's SMSC. Any competing phone service that is not just carrier pre-selection (CPS) of Eir must provide their own SMSC, but even when they do, consumers may be unable to migrate from Eir due to SMSC numbers in equipment that cannot be reprogrammed.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Eir's mobile arm provides a full range of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G-based mobile communication services throughout the Republic of Ireland. Its GSM network operates at 1800 MHz and 900 MHz ranges, as the earlier GSM licences fully utilised the 900 MHz band. <a href=""/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service"" title=""General Packet Radio Service"">GPRS</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution"" title=""Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution"">EDGE</a> data services are also available. Eir mobile provide both bill pay (contract) and prepay (non-contract) plans and has approximately 19% of the Irish mobile market, with 1,032,000 cellular subscribers on the Eir Mobile network. The company has used EDGE technology on its network and has received a 3G (UMTS) license, formally removed from Eir's competitor, <a href=""/wiki/Smart_Telecom"" title=""Smart Telecom"">Smart Telecom</a>.
</p>, <p>As an operator with significant market power, Eir is required to provide a number of wholesale products to other operators and to switch calls onto other phone networks. Many broadband products offered by other operators are resales of the Eir product.
</p>, <p>A series of <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_directory"" title=""Telephone directory"">telephone directories</a> is available for purchase and an online version is also available. The six annual directories list numbers in the local dialling area (01, 02, 04, 05, 06 or 07/09), regardless of whether the telephone service to the number is provided by Eir or by one of its competitors. Mobile numbers are not listed. ComReg has designated Eir as the organisation that has the obligation to provide a National Directory Database (NDD) and a Universal White Pages (UWP) directory; the unit within Eir responsible for providing these is the National Directory Information Unit (NDIU).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The company was formed in 1984 as <b>Bord Telecom Éireann</b>, under the Posts and Telecommunications Act 1983. (This article deals mainly with the post-privatisation Eir; for details of the company during its time as a <a href=""/wiki/State-sponsored_bodies_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland"" title=""State-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland"">state-sponsored body</a>, see <a href=""/wiki/Telecom_%C3%89ireann"" title=""Telecom Éireann"">Telecom Éireann</a>.)
From 1991 to 2013, Eir's subsidiaries included <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Phonewatch"" title=""Phonewatch"">Phonewatch</a>, then known as Eircom Phonewatch, which provides home monitoring services, monitored <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Burglar_alarm"" title=""Burglar alarm"">burglar-alarms</a>, fire alarms, CCTV systems, and medical alert devices. In May 2013, it announced that Phonewatch had been sold to Oslo-based company, <i>Sector Alarm Corporation</i>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>Although EU laws required the opening of the Irish telecommunications market, Ireland had a derogation from competition until 2003. Telecom Éireann was privatised, this was very controversial and subject to much debate. The process began in 1995, and by July 1999 the government had disposed of virtually all of its shareholding.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> Eircom plc was then floated on the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Irish_Stock_Exchange"" title=""Irish Stock Exchange"">Irish</a>, <a href=""/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange"" title=""London Stock Exchange"">London</a> and <a href=""/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"" title=""New York Stock Exchange"">New York Stock Exchanges</a> on 8 July 1999, and small/first-time investors were encouraged by the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Irish_Government"" title=""Irish Government"">Irish Government</a> to buy shares. The share price was set at €3.90, later reaching a high of €4.80, a 23% increase. Those initial investors who held onto their shares, until July 2000, received a 4% bonus-share allocation.
</p>, <p>The Eircom flotation is considered to have been an example of a <a href=""/wiki/Stock_market_bubble"" title=""Stock market bubble"">stock market bubble</a> — after the initial hype of the flotation died down, the stock price fell rapidly. Many of the 500,000 small investors were angered by the significant financial loss they incurred, blaming the government for not sufficiently warning them of the risks inherent in stock-market investment.
</p>, <p>Since privatisation, Eir's penetration of landlines has fallen from 82% to 69%. During this period, there has been a large increase in mobile phone ownership and a significant rise in line rental to the highest in Europe.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>, <p>In 2001, Eircom sold its mobile subsidiary <a href=""/wiki/Vodafone_Ireland"" title=""Vodafone Ireland"">Eircell</a> to <a href=""/wiki/Vodafone"" title=""Vodafone"">Vodafone</a>. The company was transferred to a separate entity, Eircell 2000 plc which was then sold to Vodafone through a share swap. Eircom shareholders got Eircell share in a 1000/1 ratio. The conversion rate was then 0.9478 Vodafone shares for every 2 Eircell 2000 shares. This left the Eircom shareholder with shares in both Eircom and Vodafone.
</p>, <p>After the sale of Eircell, Eircom itself was believed to be undervalued and became the subject of a bidding war between two consortia: the E-Island consortium headed by <a href=""/wiki/Denis_O%27Brien"" title=""Denis O'Brien"">Denis O'Brien</a>, and the Valentia Consortium headed by <a href=""/wiki/Tony_O%27Reilly"" title=""Tony O'Reilly"">Tony O'Reilly</a>, the chairman of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Independent_News_and_Media"" title=""Independent News and Media"">Independent News and Media</a>. Eventually in November 2001, the company agreed to a recommended offer of €1.335 per Eircom share. Eircom Plc was delisted from the stock exchange, became Eircom Limited, a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Private_limited_company_by_shares"" title=""Private limited company by shares"">private limited company by shares</a> and a subsidiary of Valentia, and O'Reilly took the reins as Executive chairman.
</p>, <p>On 19 March 2004, the company returned to the stock market (although the company being listed, <b>Eircom Group plc</b>, was in fact a new holding company, and was registered in <a href=""/wiki/England_and_Wales"" title=""England and Wales"">England and Wales</a> rather than in Ireland). The company floated at €1.55 a share, but dipped on initial trading before recovering to trade above its float price.
</p>, <p>In early 2005, several Irish newspapers reported that <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Meteor_(mobile)"" title=""Meteor (mobile)"">Meteor Mobile Communications</a>, the third mobile phone operator, was up for sale by its owners, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Western_Wireless"" title=""Western Wireless"">Western Wireless</a>.

On 9 July 2005, <i><a href=""/wiki/The_Irish_Times"" title=""The Irish Times"">The Irish Times</a></i> reported three bidders for Meteor: Eircom, <a href=""/wiki/Smart_Telecom"" title=""Smart Telecom"">Smart Telecom</a>, and a consortium led by <a href=""/wiki/Denis_O%27Brien"" title=""Denis O'Brien"">Denis O'Brien</a>.

The Employee Share Ownership Trust, which represents workers at the company, was to remain a minority shareholder. The sale was approved by shareholders on 26 July 2006, and at close of business on 17 August 2006, the shares were delisted from the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, ending Eircom's second period on the stock markets. The same day, Phillip Nolan resigned as chief executive of Eircom, and on 1 September Rex Comb was officially named as the new CEO. Tony O'Reilly resigned as chairman and was replaced by <a href=""/wiki/Pierre_Danon"" title=""Pierre Danon"">Pierre Danon</a>, previously of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/BT_Group_plc"" title=""BT Group plc"">BT Group plc</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/JP_Morgan_Chase"" title=""JP Morgan Chase"">JP Morgan Chase</a>.
Babcock and Brown have since collapsed as a company and their BCM vehicle, which owns over 50% of Eir, broke all ties with the former parent and rebranded themselves as Eircom Holdings Limited.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-12""><a href=""#cite_note-12"">[12]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>On 12 April 2018, Eir announced that they would cut 750 jobs.

</p>, <p>On 21 April 2008, Eircom rejected claims by four major record companies that it, as the largest broadband internet service provider in the state, must bear some liability for the illegal free downloading of music by computer users.

This in turn raised concerns over <a href=""/wiki/Internet_privacy"" title=""Internet privacy"">internet privacy</a>, since presumably this would be enforced through the monitoring of IP traffic associated with Eir's customers.

Eircom has reportedly signed an out-of-court settlement with said companies and are initiating a program to clamp down on piracy, within their network, by instituting an IP monitoring service, accessible by the <a href=""/wiki/Irish_Recorded_Music_Association"" title=""Irish Recorded Music Association"">Irish Recorded Music Association</a> (IRMA) and allowing up to three warnings before disconnection of service.

Eircom gave notification that they had cancelled a mandatory interest payment on their publicly-traded senior corporate bond, then due to mature in 2016.

On 22 February 2006, 3 announced the first launch of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HSDPA"" title=""HSDPA"">HSDPA</a> technology in Italy, marketed as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ADSM"" title=""ADSM"">ADSM</a> (a contraction of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/ADSL"" title=""ADSL"">ADSL</a> Mobile). On 14 May 2006, 3 was the first in Italy to launch <a href=""/wiki/DVB-H"" title=""DVB-H"">Digital Mobile TV</a> using DVB-H technology. From June 2008 to November 2011, 3 Italia offered free of charge the viewing of <a href=""/wiki/Rai_1"" title=""Rai 1"">Rai 1</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Rai_2"" title=""Rai 2"">Rai 2</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Canale_5"" title=""Canale 5"">Canale 5</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Italia_1"" title=""Italia 1"">Italia 1</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Rete_4"" title=""Rete 4"">Rete 4</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/SKY_Meteo24"" title=""SKY Meteo24"">SKY Meteo24</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Current_TV"" title=""Current TV"">Current TV</a> and <a href=""/wiki/La7"" title=""La7"">La7</a> television channels with DVB-H technology.

</p>, <p>Like other mobile-provider Internet home pages, 3's portal is 'free to browse' for some content in most 3 countries including Ireland, UK and Australia in most price plans; the user pays a fixed price for each video, text or application downloaded.
</p>, <p>Besides that, 3 UK and also 3 Ireland initially made the decision to block direct Internet access from handsets, while 3 Austria allowed access to the Internet since the beginning.
</p>, <p>In 2004, 3 released a <a href=""/wiki/PC_Card"" title=""PC Card"">PC Card</a> 3G Data Card (""NetConnect Card"") for Windows-based laptops which allows Internet access through 3's network directly from the computer, accompanied by a range of data and business tariffs. Later, more cards and USB modems for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/HSDPA"" title=""HSDPA"">HSDPA</a> were introduced.
</p>, <p>In November 2007, 3 started to sell the Skypephone, which was developed in conjunction with the Chinese phone manufacturer <a href=""/wiki/Amoi"" title=""Amoi"">Amoi</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Skype"" title=""Skype"">Skype</a>, combining the functionality of a UMTS handset with free voice calls and instant messages from Skype.  The phones were sold exclusively by 3 on contract and on a prepaid basis.
</p>, <p>3 also produced an application called ""Skype on 3"" which brought the same functionality to <a href=""/wiki/S60_(software_platform)"" title=""S60 (software platform)"">S60</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/J2ME"" title=""J2ME"">J2ME</a>-capable phones (but not <a href=""/wiki/IPhone"" title=""IPhone"">iPhone</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"" title=""Android (operating system)"">Android</a>, although some unofficial Android versions were distributed<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-58""><a href=""#cite_note-58"">[58]</a></sup>). Unlike the non-3 versions of mobile Skype, ""Skype on 3"" does not use the phone's data connection for voice calls, but instead places a normal phone call to a special number which 3 make available for this service.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-59""><a href=""#cite_note-59"">[59]</a></sup> 3 does not charge users for calls to this number.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-60""><a href=""#cite_note-60"">[60]</a></sup> This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-61""><a href=""#cite_note-61"">[61]</a></sup> A company called iSkoot (now <a href=""/wiki/Qualcomm"" title=""Qualcomm"">Qualcomm</a> iSkoot Inc.) was behind at least some of the clients and back-end servers<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-62""><a href=""#cite_note-62"">[62]</a></sup> but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-63""><a href=""#cite_note-63"">[63]</a></sup> It appears this shutdown initially affected the J2ME version and some Skypephones (which now show a ""click to upgrade"" link which either doesn't function or takes you to a page saying an upgrade is not available), but some S60 versions were not affected.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-64""><a href=""#cite_note-64"">[64]</a></sup> Skype have started sending emails indicating the Skype on 3 service will be terminated on 30 September 2014, in spite of Three's original ""free for life"" advertising. The recommended clients for smartphones will use the phone's data connection which may be liable to charges, instead of the dedicated access number used by the client, which was free to call.
</p>, <p>In February 2007, 3 introduced '3 Like Home', a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network (with the exception of 3 Indonesia) without having to pay additional roaming charges, instead paying the same amount for voice, data, and messaging services as they would do on their home network. This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad. However, pre-pay customers do not benefit fully, as they cannot use each 3 branded network for '3 Like Home'.
</p>, <p>This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks, which provide service to other partners' customers free of internal roaming charges. This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network.

"[<p>In <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecommunication"" title=""Telecommunication"">telecommunication</a>, <b>provisioning</b> involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide new services to its users.  In <a href=""/wiki/NS/EP_telecommunications"" title=""NS/EP telecommunications"">National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications</a> services, <i>""provisioning""</i> equates to  <i>""initiation""</i> and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The concept of <b>network provisioning</b> or <b>service mediation</b>, mostly used in the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecommunication_industry"" title=""Telecommunication industry"">telecommunication industry</a>, refers to the provisioning of the customer's services to the network elements, which are various equipment connected in that network communication system. Generally in telephony provisioning this is accomplished with network management database table mappings. It requires the existence of networking equipment and depends on <a href=""/wiki/Network_planning_and_design"" title=""Network planning and design"">network planning and design</a>.
</p>, <p>In a modern signal infrastructure employing <a href=""/wiki/Information_technology"" title=""Information technology"">information technology</a> (IT) at all levels, there is no possible distinction between telecommunications services and ""higher level"" infrastructure.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2014)"">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>  Accordingly, provisioning configures any required systems, provides users with access to data and technology resources, and refers to all enterprise-level information-resource management involved.
</p>, <p>Organizationally, a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Chief_Information_Officer"" title=""Chief Information Officer"">CIO</a> typically manages provisioning, necessarily involving <a href=""/wiki/Human_resources"" title=""Human resources"">human resources</a> and IT departments cooperating to:
</p>, <p>As its core, the provisioning process monitors access rights and privileges to ensure the security of an enterprise's resources and user privacy.  As a secondary responsibility, it ensures compliance and minimizes the vulnerability of systems to penetration and abuse.  As a tertiary responsibility, it tries to reduce the amount of custom configuration using <a href=""/wiki/Boot_image_control"" title=""Boot image control"">boot image control</a> and other methods that radically reduce the number of different configurations involved.
</p>, <p>Discussion of provisioning often appears in the context of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Platform_virtualization"" title=""Platform virtualization"">virtualization</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Orchestration_(computers)"" title=""Orchestration (computers)"">orchestration</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Utility_computing"" title=""Utility computing"">utility computing</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Cloud_computing"" title=""Cloud computing"">cloud computing</a>, and open-configuration concepts and projects.  For instance, the <a href=""/wiki/OASIS_(organization)"" title=""OASIS (organization)"">OASIS</a> Provisioning Services Technical Committee (PSTC) defines an <a href=""/wiki/XML"" title=""XML"">XML</a>-based framework for exchanging user, resource, and service-provisioning information - <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/SPML"" title=""SPML"">SPML</a> (Service Provisioning Markup Language) for ""managing the provisioning and allocation of identity information and system resources within and between organizations"".<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>, <p>Once provisioning has taken place, the process of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/SysOp"" title=""SysOp"">SysOpping</a> ensures the maintenance of services to the expected standards.  Provisioning thus refers only to the setup or startup part of the service operation, and SysOpping to the ongoing support.
</p>, <p>One type of provisioning.
The services which are assigned to the customer in the <a href=""/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"" title=""Customer relationship management"">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) have to be provisioned on the <a href=""/wiki/Network_element"" title=""Network element"">network element</a> which is enabling the service and allows the customer to actually use the service. The relation between a service configured in the CRM and a service on the network elements is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship; for example, services like <a href=""/wiki/Microsoft_Media_Server"" title=""Microsoft Media Server"">Microsoft Media Server</a> (mms://) can be enabled by more than one network element.
</p>, <p>During the provisioning, the service mediation device translates the service and the corresponding parameters of the service to one or more services/parameters on the network elements involved. The algorithm used to translate a system service into network services is called <b>provisioning logic</b>.
</p>, <p>Electronic invoice feeds from your carriers can be automatically downloaded directly into the core of the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecom_expense_management"" title=""Telecom expense management"">telecom expense management</a> (TEM) software and it will immediately conduct an audit of each single line item charge all the way down to the User Support and Operations Center (USOC) level. The provisioning software will capture each circuit number provided by all of your carriers and if billing occurs outside of the contracted rate an exception rule will trigger a red flag and notify the pre-established staff member to review the billing error.
</p>, <p>Server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems, data and software, and make it ready for network operation. Typical tasks when provisioning a server are: select a <a href=""/wiki/Server_(computing)"" title=""Server (computing)"">server</a> from a pool of available servers, load the appropriate <a href=""/wiki/Software"" title=""Software"">software</a> (<a href=""/wiki/Operating_system"" title=""Operating system"">operating system</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Device_driver"" title=""Device driver"">device drivers</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Middleware"" title=""Middleware"">middleware</a>, and <a href=""/wiki/Application_software"" title=""Application software"">applications</a>), appropriately customize and configure the system and the software to create or change a <a href=""/wiki/Boot_image"" title=""Boot image"">boot image</a> for this server, and then change its parameters, such as <a href=""/wiki/IP_address"" title=""IP address"">IP address</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)"" title=""Gateway (telecommunications)"">IP Gateway</a> to find associated network and storage resources (sometimes separated as <i>resource provisioning</i>) to audit the system. By auditing the system, you ensure <a href=""/wiki/Open_Vulnerability_and_Assessment_Language"" title=""Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language"">OVAL</a> compliance with limit vulnerability, ensure compliance, or install patches. After these actions, you restart the system and load the new software. This makes the system ready for operation. Typically an <a href=""/wiki/Internet_service_provider"" title=""Internet service provider"">internet service provider</a> (ISP) or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Network_Operations_Center"" title=""Network Operations Center"">Network Operations Center</a> will perform these tasks to a well-defined set of parameters, for example, a boot image that the organization has approved and which uses software it has license to. Many instances of such a boot image create a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Virtual_host"" title=""Virtual host"">virtual</a> <a href=""/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service"" title=""Dedicated hosting service"">dedicated host</a>.
</p>, <p>There are many <a href=""/wiki/Software"" title=""Software"">software</a> products available to automate the provisioning of servers, services and end-user devices. Examples: BMC Bladelogic Server Automation, HP Server Automation, <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=IBM_Tivoli&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""IBM Tivoli (page does not exist)"">IBM Tivoli</a> Provisioning Manager, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Redhat"" title=""Redhat"">Redhat</a> Kickstart, xCAT, HP Insight CMU, etc.  Middleware and applications can be installed either when the operating system is installed or afterwards by using an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Application_Service_Automation"" title=""Application Service Automation"">Application Service Automation</a> tool. Further questions are addressed in academia such as when provisioning should be issued and how many servers are needed in multi-tier,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup> or multi-service applications.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In <a href=""/wiki/Cloud_computing"" title=""Cloud computing"">cloud computing</a>, servers may be provisioned via a web user interface or an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Application_programming_interface"" title=""Application programming interface"">application programming interface</a> (API). One of the unique things about cloud computing is how rapidly and easily this can be done.  Monitoring software can be used to trigger automatic provisioning when existing resources become too heavily stressed.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In short, server provisioning configures servers based on resource requirements. The use of a hardware or software component (e.g. single/dual processor, RAM, HDD, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/RAID_Controller"" title=""RAID Controller"">RAID Controller</a>, a number of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/LAN_card"" title=""LAN card"">LAN cards</a>, applications, OS, etc.) depends on the functionality of the server, such as ISP, virtualization, NOS, or voice processing. Server redundancy depends on the availability of servers in the organization. Critical applications have less downtime when using cluster servers, RAID, or a mirroring system.
</p>, <p>Service used by most larger-scale centers in part to avoid this. Additional <b>resource provisioning</b> may be done per service.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>There are several software on the market for server provisioning such as <a href=""/wiki/Cobbler_(software)"" title=""Cobbler (software)"">Cobbler</a> or HP Intelligent Provisioning.
</p>, <p>User provisioning refers to the creation, maintenance and deactivation of user objects and user attributes, as they exist in one or more systems, directories or applications, in response to automated or interactive business processes.  User provisioning software may include one or more of the following processes: change propagation, self-service <a href=""/wiki/Workflow"" title=""Workflow"">workflow</a>, consolidated user administration, delegated user administration, and federated change control.  User objects may represent employees, contractors, vendors, partners, customers or other recipients of a service.  Services may include <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Electronic_mail"" title=""Electronic mail"">electronic mail</a>, inclusion in a published <a href=""/wiki/Directory_service"" title=""Directory service"">user directory</a>, access to a <a href=""/wiki/Database"" title=""Database"">database</a>, access to a network or mainframe, etc.  User provisioning is a type of <a href=""/wiki/Identity_management"" title=""Identity management"">identity management</a> software, particularly useful within organizations, where users may be represented by multiple objects on multiple systems and multiple instances.
</p>, <p>On-demand self-service is described by the <a href=""/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology"" title=""National Institute of Standards and Technology"">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) as an essential characteristic of <a href=""/wiki/Cloud_computing"" title=""Cloud computing"">cloud computing</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup> The self-service nature of cloud computing lets end users obtain and remove cloud services―including applications, the infrastructure supporting the applications,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup> and configuration―<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup> themselves without requiring the assistance of an IT staff member.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> The automatic self-servicing may target different application goals and constraints (e.g. deadlines and cost),<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-sc2011workflow_10-0""><a href=""#cite_note-sc2011workflow-10"">[10]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-sc2013scaling_11-0""><a href=""#cite_note-sc2013scaling-11"">[11]</a></sup> as well as handling different application architectures (e.g., bags-of-tasks and workflows).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-grid2010_12-0""><a href=""#cite_note-grid2010-12"">[12]</a></sup> Cloud users can obtain cloud services through a cloud service catalog or a self-service portal.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup> Because business users can obtain and configure cloud services themselves, this means IT staff can be more productive and gives them more time to manage cloud infrastructures.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>One downside of cloud service provisioning is that it is not instantaneous. A cloud <a href=""/wiki/Virtual_machine"" title=""Virtual machine"">virtual machine</a> (VM) can be acquired at any time by the user, but it may take up to several minutes for the acquired VM to be ready to use. The VM startup time is dependent on factors, such as image size, VM type, <a href=""/wiki/Data_center"" title=""Data center"">data center</a> location, and number of VMs.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-vmstartuptime2012_15-0""><a href=""#cite_note-vmstartuptime2012-15"">[15]</a></sup> Cloud providers have different VM startup performance.
</p>, <p>Mobile subscriber provisioning refers to the setting up of new services, such as <a href=""/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service"" title=""General Packet Radio Service"">GPRS</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service"" title=""Multimedia Messaging Service"">MMS</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Instant_Messaging"" title=""Instant Messaging"">Instant Messaging</a> for an existing subscriber of a <a href=""/wiki/Mobile_phone"" title=""Mobile phone"">mobile phone</a> network, and any gateways to standard Internet <a href=""/wiki/Online_chat"" title=""Online chat"">chat</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Mail"" title=""Mail"">mail</a> services.  The network operator typically sends these settings to the subscriber's handset using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Short_message_service"" title=""Short message service"">SMS</a> text services or <a href=""/wiki/HTML"" title=""HTML"">HTML</a>, and less commonly <a href=""/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol"" title=""Wireless Application Protocol"">WAP</a>, depending on what the <a href=""/wiki/Mobile_operating_system"" title=""Mobile operating system"">mobile operating systems</a> can accept.
</p>, <p>A general example of provisioning is with data services. A mobile user who is using his or her device for voice calling may wish to switch to data services in order to read emails or browse the Internet. The mobile device's services are ""provisioned"" and thus the user is able to stay connected through push emails and other features of smartphone services.

"[<p><b>Telecommunications in Poland</b> include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.
</p>, <p>The market for fixed line telephony services and infrastructure was monopolized by the state until 1990. The state monopoly was implemented by the <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=Polish_Post,_Telegraph_and_Telephone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" title=""Polish Post, Telegraph and Telephone (page does not exist)"">PPTiT</a> which was subordinated to the Ministry of Communications. The telephony segments of that entity were spun-off and incorporated into <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telekomunikacja_Polska"" title=""Telekomunikacja Polska"">Telekomunikacja Polska</a> which was later privatized and sold to Orange Polska. The Telecommunications Act of 1990 allowed the provision of telecommunication infrastructure and services by the former monopoly. After 2000, other operators were allowed to use TP's telecommunications infrastructure under Third-party Access.
</p>, <p>From the communist era Poland inherited an underdeveloped and outmoded system of telephones, with some areas (e.g. in the extreme South East) being served by manual exchanges. In December 2005 the last analog exchange was shut down. All telephone lines are now served by modern fully computerized exchanges (Siemens <a href=""/wiki/EWSD"" title=""EWSD"">EWSD</a>, Alcatel S12, Lucent <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/5ESS"" title=""5ESS"">5ESS</a>, Alcatel E10). The former state owned telephone monopoly (<a href=""/wiki/Orange_Polska"" title=""Orange Polska"">TPSA</a>) has been mostly privatized, with France Telecom buying the largest share. Various other companies have entered the fixed phone market, but generally aiming for niches (e.g. Sferia with fixed wireless, <a href=""/wiki/Netia"" title=""Netia"">Netia</a> covering primarily business). Whilst prices have reduced and availability has increased considerably since the introduction of competition, there is little sign of TPSA's market share being seriously reduced.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources.

"[<p>A <b>telecommunications lease</b> is a lease that exists between a <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a> provider or wireless company, and a landowner. Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landowner’s property for a telecommunications site or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cellular_tower"" title=""Cellular tower"">cellular tower</a> for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup>  Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.
</p>, <p>The telecommunication industry is growing as the need for <a href=""/wiki/4G"" title=""4G"">4G</a> and <a href=""/wiki/5G"" title=""5G"">5G</a> networks flourishes.  As a result of this growth there is a constant demand for cellular networks to increase their coverage. Therefore, more cellular towers are constructed and more leases are drawn up between the cellular provider and landowners, which can include municipalities and private landowners, such as homeowners.
</p>, <p>In the telecommunications industry, there are two types of telecommunications leases: a rooftop lease agreement and a ground lease agreement. In some cases, cellular sites are installed on the roofs of commercial office buildings and even residential living complexes. These rooftop installations take advantage of the height of the buildings on which they are installed to provide quality cellular coverage.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> Ground leases, on the other hand are contracts typically made between the cellular provider and the landowner of a property for space at the ground level on which a cellular tower is installed.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Rooftops are leased for many different communication purposes, including many different types of antennas.  Panel antennas are commonly placed on rooftops in urban and densely populated residential areas.  These antennas typically range from 1–10 feet in height and have the ability to service multiple technologies, including: cellular antennas, PCS antennas, specialized mobile radios, fixed wireless services, and paging services.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Satellite dishes are also mounted on some rooftops, primarily for satellite TV service, but in other cases much larger dishes are used.  These antennas generally address Internet and cable needs and therefore are used for services such as video conferencing.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Rooftop leases include details about the amount of space leased, installation methods, and upgrade procedures that allow the tenant to operate at the site as needed, while protecting the landlords building.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Ground leases generally address antenna towers or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Billboards"" title=""Billboards"">billboards</a> in which the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the tower.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup>  Antenna towers range between 50 and 300 feet tall.  These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” to blend in with the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively.
</p>, <p>Cellular providers such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Verizon_Wireless"" title=""Verizon Wireless"">Verizon Wireless</a> and <a href=""/wiki/AT%26T"" title=""AT&amp;T"">AT&amp;T</a> most commonly use ground leases.<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>, <p>Proposals for new <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cell_tower"" title=""Cell tower"">cell towers</a> sometimes face public opposition in zoning proceedings from residents who raise aesthetic objections and fear health hazards.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-10""><a href=""#cite_note-10"">[10]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11"">[11]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-12""><a href=""#cite_note-12"">[12]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Local zoning boards must follow the rules set forth in the <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996"" title=""Telecommunications Act of 1996"">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup> which sets guidelines for what are acceptable reasons to not permit the construction of a new cellular tower.
</p>, <p>Generally cellular providers look for property that is in a densely populated area and that falls outside of a five-mile radius from the nearest tower.  For a cellular company, redundancy occurs when two or more towers serve the same area.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-14""><a href=""#cite_note-14"">[14]</a></sup>  This often causes a loss of income for the cellular provider, as they generally need one tower rather than multiple.  As companies continue to merge, redundancy has become a rising issue within the telecommunication industry.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Generally, telecom leases are for an initial five-year term followed by additional five-year renewal terms.  Leases typically also have a 30- to 90-day cancellation period when the cellular provider has the right to terminate the lease within 30 to 90 days of giving notice to the landowner.  This specific portion of a telecom lease is due to recent mergers in the industry, which render some towers useless.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>  Due to cellular providers merging with other cellular companies, one company can double its number of towers.  This often causes redundancy, as previously mentioned, which often leads to the termination of leases and removal of redundant towers.
</p>, <p>The <a href=""/wiki/Fair_market_value"" title=""Fair market value"">fair market value</a> of a lease is generally determined by the importance of the location to the cellular carrier's network, or the value of the coverage the location provides. Value will also be driven by the availability of surrounding alternate sites. Determining the fair market value of a cellular lease is difficult for most landowners due to lack of available information. Cell tower lease rates are not public information, and these rates vary widely. There are however companies that specialize in providing information and assistance to property owners in this highly specialized field.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-17""><a href=""#cite_note-17"">[17]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In order to make money, cellular carriers often undervalue a lease.  Leasing agents typically receive bonuses for signing low-priced leases, and therefore undervalue leases because the worse the deal is for the landowner, the greater the benefits are for the leasing agent. There are several methods for a landowner to evaluate their property:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Cellular_colocation"" title=""Cellular colocation"">Colocation</a> is when the cellular company allows other companies to build on their tower.  As a result, the cellular company that owns the tower receives a rent from the co-locators.  Within a lease, landowners can address colocation and receive a portion of the rent received by the cellular company.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-19""><a href=""#cite_note-19"">[19]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-20""><a href=""#cite_note-20"">[20]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Property owners have the ability to sell their cell tower lease separate from their parcel. Investors purchase the cell tower lease as an easement or lease assignment. Three main factors that influence cell tower buyout prices are: current rent, the rent escalator, and the date of lease expiration.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-21""><a href=""#cite_note-21"">[21]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Different types of cell tower lease buyout offers have  different implications for landowners. For example, a cell tower lease buyout on farmland is much different than the purchase of a lease on a building rooftop. Some necessary considerations for cell tower lease buyout transactions are:<sup class=""noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"" style=""white-space:nowrap;"">[<i><a href=""/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"" title=""Wikipedia:Citation needed""><span title=""This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>, <p>The challenges of selling a cellular leasehold is the acquisition market is highly unregulated.  Lease Acquisition agents have the ability to modify and deliver information to the landowner to acquire leaseholds at a highly discounted price.   Similar the oil barons of the 1800s, these agents are compensated heavily to obtain these rights, and often the underlying value of expiration and an expanded sale market is shielded from the landowner.

It was acquired by <a href=""/wiki/TE_Connectivity"" title=""TE Connectivity"">TE Connectivity</a> (Tyco Electronics) in December 2010 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. It vacated its Eden Prairie location in May 2011 and moved staff and resources to other locations. ADC products were sold by <a href=""/wiki/CommScope"" title=""CommScope"">CommScope</a> after it acquired the Broadband Network Solutions business unit (including ADC) from TE Connectivity in August 2015.
</p>, <p>In 1935, fellow engineers Ralph Allison and Walter Lehnert were each operating business efforts out of their respective basements; Ralph Allison was building audio amplifiers and Walter Lehnert was building transformers. In the fall of 1936, the two combined their efforts to form the Audio Development Company (ADC).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup> The company was later renamed to ADC Telecommunications, Inc.
</p>, <p>During their first year in business, ADC built hearing aids and audiometers—a machine used for evaluating hearing acuity. Initially the audiometers were built for Maico, but in 1945 ADC began building audiometers under its own name. Additionally, by 1942, the company had designed a sophisticated audio system for the <a href=""/wiki/University_of_Minnesota"" title=""University of Minnesota"">University of Minnesota</a>, and the resulting <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Jack_(connector)"" title=""Jack (connector)"">jacks</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Plug_(connector)"" title=""Plug (connector)"">plugs</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Patch_cords"" title=""Patch cords"">patch cords</a> and jackfields became the cornerstones for ADC's later entry into telecommunications.
</p>, <p>In 1949, ADC sold its audiometer product line and Ralph Allison left the company to form a new business in California. With Walter Lehnert remaining as president of the company, ADC diversified and focused its efforts in the area of transformers and filters for power lines, military electronics, telephone jacks and plugs.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In 1961, ADC merged with Magnetic Controls Company, a manufacturer of power supplies and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Magnetic_amplifiers"" title=""Magnetic amplifiers"">magnetic amplifiers</a> with strong ties to the U.S. space program. The resulting company, ADC Magnetic Controls, had a decade of mixed success. Although transformer sales boomed during the 1960s, other new product initiatives failed to materialize. Perhaps the most significant product innovation during this period was the bantam jack, a miniaturized component that eventually became the standard for telephone circuit access and patching. Building on its growing sales of jacks and plugs in the early 1970s, ADC introduced prewired, connectorized jackfields, wired assemblies and test equipment for telephone operating companies. By 1974 the company was on solid ground, and by 1976, ADC had become the largest independent supplier of test boards in the United States.
</p>, <p>ADC grew in 1983, when <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph"" title=""American Telephone &amp; Telegraph"">AT&amp;T</a> was ordered to deregulate by the federal government. By establishing the seven <a href=""/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Company"" title=""Regional Bell Operating Company"">Regional Bell Operating Company</a> (RBOC) carriers as independent entities, the U.S. market for telecommunications expanded by 90 percent. ADC became a supplier for the RBOCs.
</p>, <p>ADC embarked on some acquisitions in the early 1990s, attempting to move ""up the stack"" in the datacom field by acquiring companies that manufactured datacom equipment.  However, their ability to find synergies between these companies proved limited and eventually ADC was forced to move away from a hardware-only strategy, broadening out into software.  This effort resulted in limited success as well, and happening about the same time as the dot-com bubble burst, caused ADC stock to plummet. Despite these ups and downs, ADC continued to survive and on July 13, 2010, the company released this announcement: ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Tyco_Electronics"" title=""Tyco Electronics"">Tyco Electronics</a> (NYSE: TEL) and ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) announced today a definitive agreement under which Tyco Electronics will acquire ADC for $12.75 per share in cash, or an <a href=""/wiki/Enterprise_value"" title=""Enterprise value"">enterprise value</a> of approximately $1.25 billion.

Signals can be either <a href=""/wiki/Analog_signal"" title=""Analog signal"">analog</a>, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Digital_signal_(electronics)"" title=""Digital signal (electronics)"">digital</a>, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information.
</p>, <p>For analog signals, signal processing may involve the <a href=""/wiki/Amplifier"" title=""Amplifier"">amplification</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Audio_filter"" title=""Audio filter"">filtering</a> of audio signals for audio equipment or the <a href=""/wiki/Modulation"" title=""Modulation"">modulation</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Demodulation"" title=""Demodulation"">demodulation</a> of signals for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Telecommunication"" title=""Telecommunication"">telecommunications</a>. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the <a href=""/wiki/Data_compression"" title=""Data compression"">compression</a>, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Error_checking"" title=""Error checking"">error checking</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Error_detection"" title=""Error detection"">error detection</a> of digital signals.
</p>, <p><b>Telecommunications engineering</b> deals with the <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)"" title=""Transmission (telecommunications)"">transmission</a> of <a href=""/wiki/Information"" title=""Information"">information</a> across a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Channel_(communications)"" title=""Channel (communications)"">channel</a> such as a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Coax_cable"" title=""Coax cable"">co-axial cable</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Optical_fiber"" title=""Optical fiber"">optical fiber</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Free_space"" title=""Free space"">free space</a>.
</p>, <p>Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a <a href=""/wiki/Carrier_wave"" title=""Carrier wave"">carrier wave</a> in order to shift the information to a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Carrier_frequency"" title=""Carrier frequency"">carrier frequency</a> suitable for transmission, this is known as <a href=""/wiki/Modulation"" title=""Modulation"">modulation</a>. Popular analog modulation techniques include <a href=""/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"" title=""Amplitude modulation"">amplitude modulation</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Frequency_modulation"" title=""Frequency modulation"">frequency modulation</a>. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.
</p>, <p>Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the <a href=""/wiki/Transmitter"" title=""Transmitter"">transmitters</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"" title=""Receiver (radio)"">receivers</a> needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a <a href=""/wiki/Transceiver"" title=""Transceiver"">transceiver</a>. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Power_consumption"" title=""Power consumption"">power consumption</a> as this is closely related to their <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Signal_strength"" title=""Signal strength"">signal strength</a>. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Signal_noise"" title=""Signal noise"">noise</a>.
</p>, <p><b>Aviation</b>-<b>Electronic Engineering</b> and <b>Aviation-Telecommunications Engineering,</b> They research and work on <a href=""/wiki/Electronics"" title=""Electronics"">electronics</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Aerospace"" title=""Aerospace"">aerospace</a> topics. Aviation-<a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications_engineering"" title=""Telecommunications engineering"">telecommunication engineers</a> include a group of specialists who have a lot of information about the flight (such as <a href=""/wiki/Meteorology"" title=""Meteorology"">meteorological</a> data, some specific information, etc.) through the available platforms (such as AFTN, etc.) at the disposal of the aircraft itself or parts Others are stationed at airports. Specialists in this field mainly need knowledge of <a href=""/wiki/Computer_science"" title=""Computer science"">computer</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Computer_network"" title=""Computer network"">networking</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Information_technology"" title=""Information technology"">IT</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Physics"" title=""Physics"">physics</a>.Their works are in organizations and companies in the air and space. Before, during and after the flight, the aircraft needs equipment and platforms that meet many of its needs such as navigation information, communication and monitoring systems (CNS). Of course, such equipment requires installation, commissioning, maintenance and repair, which is a serious task for an aviation electronics specialist at the airports. These courses are offered at different universities like <a href=""/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Technology_College"" title=""Civil Aviation Technology College"">Civil Aviation Technology College</a><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-18""><a href=""#cite_note-18"">[18]</a></sup>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-19""><a href=""#cite_note-19"">[19]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Electromagnetics</b> is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves, Transmission Lines and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Waveguides"" title=""Waveguides"">Waveguides</a>, Antennas, its types and applications with <a href=""/wiki/Radio_frequency"" title=""Radio frequency"">Radio-Frequency</a> (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.
</p>, <p><b>Control engineering</b> has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of <a href=""/wiki/Airliner"" title=""Airliner"">commercial airplanes</a> to the <a href=""/wiki/Cruise_control"" title=""Cruise control"">cruise control</a> present in many modern <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Automobile"" title=""Automobile"">cars</a>. It also plays an important role in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Industrial_automation"" title=""Industrial automation"">industrial automation</a>.
</p>, <p>Control engineers often utilize <a href=""/wiki/Feedback"" title=""Feedback"">feedback</a> when designing <a href=""/wiki/Control_system"" title=""Control system"">control systems</a>. For example, in a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Automobile"" title=""Automobile"">car</a> with <a href=""/wiki/Cruise_control"" title=""Cruise control"">cruise control</a>, the vehicle's <a href=""/wiki/Speed"" title=""Speed"">speed</a> is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the <a href=""/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"" title=""Internal combustion engine"">engine's</a> power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, <a href=""/wiki/Control_theory"" title=""Control theory"">control theory</a> can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.
</p>, <p><b>Instrumentation engineering</b> deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as <a href=""/wiki/Pressure"" title=""Pressure"">pressure</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Mass_flow_rate"" title=""Mass flow rate"">flow</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Temperature"" title=""Temperature"">temperature</a>. These devices are known as <a href=""/wiki/Instrumentation"" title=""Instrumentation"">instrumentation</a>.
</p>, <p>The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of <a href=""/wiki/Physics"" title=""Physics"">physics</a> that often extends beyond <a href=""/wiki/Electromagnetism"" title=""Electromagnetism"">electromagnetic theory</a>. For example, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Radar_gun"" title=""Radar gun"">radar guns</a> use the <a href=""/wiki/Doppler_effect"" title=""Doppler effect"">Doppler effect</a> to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, <a href=""/wiki/Thermocouple"" title=""Thermocouple"">thermocouples</a> use the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Peltier%E2%80%93Seebeck_effect"" title=""Peltier–Seebeck effect"">Peltier–Seebeck effect</a> to measure the temperature difference between two points.
</p>, <p>Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the <a href=""/wiki/Sensor"" title=""Sensor"">sensors</a> of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-20""><a href=""#cite_note-20"">[20]</a></sup>
</p>, <p><b>Computer engineering</b> deals with the design of <a href=""/wiki/Computer"" title=""Computer"">computers</a> and computer systems. This may involve the design of new <a href=""/wiki/Computer_hardware"" title=""Computer hardware"">computer hardware</a>, the design of <a href=""/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"" title=""Personal digital assistant"">PDAs</a> or the use of computers to control an <a href=""/wiki/Manufacturing"" title=""Manufacturing"">industrial plant</a>. Development of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Embedded_systems"" title=""Embedded systems"">embedded systems</a>—systems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)—is also included in this field.  This field includes the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Micro_controller"" title=""Micro controller"">micro controller</a> and its applications.
Computer engineers may also work on a system's <a href=""/wiki/Software"" title=""Software"">software</a>. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of <a href=""/wiki/Software_engineering"" title=""Software engineering"">software engineering</a>, which is usually considered a separate discipline.
</p>, <p><b>VLSI design engineering</b> <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/VLSI"" title=""VLSI"">VLSI</a> stands for <i>very large scale integration</i>. It deals with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components.
</p>, <p>Electronics engineers typically possess an <a href=""/wiki/Academic_degree"" title=""Academic degree"">academic degree</a> with a major in electronic engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a <a href=""/wiki/Bachelor_of_Engineering"" title=""Bachelor of Engineering"">Bachelor of Engineering</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"" title=""Bachelor of Science"">Bachelor of Science</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Bachelor_of_Applied_Science"" title=""Bachelor of Applied Science"">Bachelor of Applied Science</a>, or <a href=""/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology"" title=""Bachelor of Technology"">Bachelor of Technology</a> depending upon the university.  Many UK universities also offer <a href=""/wiki/Master_of_Engineering"" title=""Master of Engineering"">Master of Engineering</a> (<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/MEng"" title=""MEng"">MEng</a>) degrees at the graduate level.
</p>, <p>Some electronics engineers also choose to pursue a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Postgraduate"" title=""Postgraduate"">postgraduate</a> degree such as a <a href=""/wiki/Master_of_Science"" title=""Master of Science"">Master of Science</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy"" title=""Doctor of Philosophy"">Doctor of Philosophy</a> in Engineering, or an <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Engineering_Doctorate"" title=""Engineering Doctorate"">Engineering Doctorate</a>. The master's degree is being introduced in some European and American Universities as a first degree and the differentiation of an engineer with graduate and postgraduate studies is often difficult. In these cases, experience is taken into account. The master's degree may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia.
</p>, <p>In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. Certification allows engineers to legally sign off on plans for projects affecting public safety.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-21""><a href=""#cite_note-21"">[21]</a></sup> After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements, including work experience requirements, before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada, and South Africa), <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Chartered_Engineer"" title=""Chartered Engineer"">Chartered Engineer</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Incorporated_Engineer"" title=""Incorporated Engineer"">Incorporated Engineer</a> (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or <a href=""/wiki/European_Engineer"" title=""European Engineer"">European Engineer</a> (in much of the European Union).
</p>, <p>A degree in electronics generally includes units covering <a href=""/wiki/Physics"" title=""Physics"">physics</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Chemistry"" title=""Chemistry"">chemistry</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Mathematics"" title=""Mathematics"">mathematics</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Project_management"" title=""Project management"">project management</a> and specific topics in <a href=""/wiki/Electrical_engineering"" title=""Electrical engineering"">electrical engineering</a>. Initially, such topics cover most, if not all, of the subfields of electronic engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subfields towards the end of the degree.
</p>, <p>Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use <a href=""/wiki/Computer-aided_design"" title=""Computer-aided design"">computer-aided design</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Simulation_software"" title=""Simulation software"">simulation software</a> programs when designing electronic systems. Although most electronic engineers will understand basic circuit theory, the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Quantum_mechanic"" title=""Quantum mechanic"">quantum mechanics</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Solid_state_physics"" title=""Solid state physics"">solid state physics</a> might be relevant to an engineer working on <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/VLSI"" title=""VLSI"">VLSI</a> but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Embedded_systems"" title=""Embedded systems"">embedded systems</a>.

</p>, <p>For most engineers not involved at the cutting edge of system design and development, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time is also spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason, project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.
</p>, <p>The workplaces of electronics engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electronics engineers may be found in the pristine laboratory environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or in a research laboratory. During their working life, electronics engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers and other engineers.
</p>, <p>Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electronics engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency.

"[<p>In <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a>, a <b>callback</b> or <b>call-back</b> occurs when the originator of a call is immediately called back in a second call as a response.
</p>, <p>A callback, in this sense is a method of making low-cost international calls via a third country, usually the <a href=""/wiki/United_States"" title=""United States"">United States</a>, where call charges are considerably lower. One variation of this technology was developed by <a href=""/wiki/IDT_Corporation"" title=""IDT Corporation"">IDT Corporation</a> in 1991.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup> IDT Corp used a hardware solution that was never widely accepted and ultimately failed and was surpassed by a software solution concurrently developed by Jorge Blanco at MCI Telecommunications for The United Nations Development Programme and their staff Wolfgang Scholtes and Kumar Navaratnum.
</p>, <p>In order to use a callback service, a subscriber is allocated a unique number in, for example, the US, which must first be dialled in order to trigger a return call. This is known (in the US) as a Direct Inbound Dialing (DID) number, or in the <a href=""/wiki/United_Kingdom"" title=""United Kingdom"">UK</a> as a Direct Dial-In (DDI) number. Where <a href=""/wiki/Caller_ID"" title=""Caller ID"">Caller ID</a> is available, it may be possible to use the same DID number for many different subscribers, as the callback system will be able to recognise each subscriber's registered number.
</p>, <p>On hearing a ringing tone, the subscriber simply hangs up and awaits the callback. On receiving this, usually within a few seconds, the customer picks up the phone and dials the required number. This may mean dialling in the <a href=""/wiki/North_America"" title=""North America"">North American</a> format, as most callback services are US-based, and callers are effectively calling from the US. For example, a number in <a href=""/wiki/Manhattan"" title=""Manhattan"">Manhattan</a> would be dialled with the trunk code, area code and subscriber's number, as follows:
</p>, <p>A call to <a href=""/wiki/London"" title=""London"">London</a> in the <a href=""/wiki/United_Kingdom"" title=""United Kingdom"">UK</a>, would require the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/International_access_code"" title=""International access code"">international access code</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Country_calling_code"" title=""Country calling code"">country calling code</a>, as follows:
</p>, <p>In the <a href=""/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan"" title=""North American Numbering Plan"">North American Numbering Plan</a>, <b>011</b> is used as the international access code, but in most countries, <b>00</b> is used, in line with <a href=""/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""International Telecommunication Union"">International Telecommunication Union</a>'s Recommendation <a href=""/wiki/E.164"" title=""E.164"">E.164</a>.
</p>, <p>The cost of making a telephone call via callback consists of two parts, as the caller is effectively paying for an outbound and inbound call at the same time. For example, if a customer from <a href=""/wiki/Spain"" title=""Spain"">Spain</a> is calling a phone number in <a href=""/wiki/Australia"" title=""Australia"">Australia</a>, and it costs 8 cents per minute to phone Spain from the US (the callback, which is an incoming call) and 20 cents per minute to phone Australia from the US (the destination call, which is an outgoing call), then the caller will pay a total of 28 US cents a minute. This may still be less expensive than calling directly from Spain to Australia, which is primarily why callbacks are used.
</p>, <p>Callback is often automated through the use of <a href=""/wiki/Web_callback"" title=""Web callback"">web callback</a> or mobile phone applications by companies such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/GlobalTel"" title=""GlobalTel"">GlobalTel</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Jajah"" title=""Jajah"">Jajah</a>, or on <a href=""/wiki/Roaming_SIM"" title=""Roaming SIM"">Roaming SIMs</a>.
</p>, <p>Many countries have banned callback services, on the grounds that they are not licensed or regulated by their governments, and deprive telephone companies in many developing countries of revenue from international calls. People who provide or use callback services have argued that these telephone companies are often state monopolies that charge unjustifiably high prices for international calls. It may also be the only way of making calls to certain countries from others, for example, <a href=""/wiki/Israel"" title=""Israel"">Israel</a> from other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Middle_Eastern"" title=""Middle Eastern"">Middle Eastern</a> countries.
</p>, <p>Other countries have sought to use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch tone dialing. However, this is also overcome by the use of speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Short_message_service"" title=""Short message service"">SMS</a>.
</p>, <p>The use of callback in most developed countries has declined, owing to the liberalization of telecommunication services, which allow more direct access to low-cost international calls, without the need for a time-consuming process like callback. Also, the advent of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol"" title=""Voice over Internet Protocol"">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> services has allowed many people to make international calls via their computer connected to the Internet, although sound quality can be poorer on slower dial-up connections than on <a href=""/wiki/Broadband"" title=""Broadband"">broadband</a> ones.
</p>, <p>International callback has been credited with opening global telecom markets because it enabled competition to start up even if regulatory restrictions existed. It was popularized by a 1994 book, ""The International CallBack Book"" by Gene Retske.
</p>, <p>A <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modem</a> allows one <a href=""/wiki/Computer"" title=""Computer"">computer</a> (the client) to establish a connection to another (the server) by dialing the server's <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_number"" title=""Telephone number"">telephone number</a>.  This is sometimes viewed as being insecure because there is no <a href=""/wiki/Authentication"" title=""Authentication"">authentication</a> of the call originator.  One way to increase <a href=""/wiki/Computer_security"" title=""Computer security"">security</a> is to enforce a modem callback <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Protocol_(computing)"" title=""Protocol (computing)"">protocol</a>, which usually proceeds as a series of steps:
</p>, <p>Sometimes callback modem setups can also be used for <a href=""/wiki/Billback"" title=""Billback"">billback</a> purposes, allowing the originator to avoid lengthy toll charges.
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Automatic_ring_back"" title=""Automatic ring back"">Automatic ring back</a>, to an engaged number, sometimes referred to as callback

"[<p>In <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a>, a <b>callback</b> or <b>call-back</b> occurs when the originator of a call is immediately called back in a second call as a response.
</p>, <p>A callback, in this sense is a method of making low-cost international calls via a third country, usually the <a href=""/wiki/United_States"" title=""United States"">United States</a>, where call charges are considerably lower. One variation of this technology was developed by <a href=""/wiki/IDT_Corporation"" title=""IDT Corporation"">IDT Corporation</a> in 1991.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup> IDT Corp used a hardware solution that was never widely accepted and ultimately failed and was surpassed by a software solution concurrently developed by Jorge Blanco at MCI Telecommunications for The United Nations Development Programme and their staff Wolfgang Scholtes and Kumar Navaratnum.
</p>, <p>In order to use a callback service, a subscriber is allocated a unique number in, for example, the US, which must first be dialled in order to trigger a return call. This is known (in the US) as a Direct Inbound Dialing (DID) number, or in the <a href=""/wiki/United_Kingdom"" title=""United Kingdom"">UK</a> as a Direct Dial-In (DDI) number. Where <a href=""/wiki/Caller_ID"" title=""Caller ID"">Caller ID</a> is available, it may be possible to use the same DID number for many different subscribers, as the callback system will be able to recognise each subscriber's registered number.
</p>, <p>On hearing a ringing tone, the subscriber simply hangs up and awaits the callback. On receiving this, usually within a few seconds, the customer picks up the phone and dials the required number. This may mean dialling in the <a href=""/wiki/North_America"" title=""North America"">North American</a> format, as most callback services are US-based, and callers are effectively calling from the US. For example, a number in <a href=""/wiki/Manhattan"" title=""Manhattan"">Manhattan</a> would be dialled with the trunk code, area code and subscriber's number, as follows:
</p>, <p>A call to <a href=""/wiki/London"" title=""London"">London</a> in the <a href=""/wiki/United_Kingdom"" title=""United Kingdom"">UK</a>, would require the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/International_access_code"" title=""International access code"">international access code</a> and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Country_calling_code"" title=""Country calling code"">country calling code</a>, as follows:
</p>, <p>In the <a href=""/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan"" title=""North American Numbering Plan"">North American Numbering Plan</a>, <b>011</b> is used as the international access code, but in most countries, <b>00</b> is used, in line with <a href=""/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union"" title=""International Telecommunication Union"">International Telecommunication Union</a>'s Recommendation <a href=""/wiki/E.164"" title=""E.164"">E.164</a>.
</p>, <p>The cost of making a telephone call via callback consists of two parts, as the caller is effectively paying for an outbound and inbound call at the same time. For example, if a customer from <a href=""/wiki/Spain"" title=""Spain"">Spain</a> is calling a phone number in <a href=""/wiki/Australia"" title=""Australia"">Australia</a>, and it costs 8 cents per minute to phone Spain from the US (the callback, which is an incoming call) and 20 cents per minute to phone Australia from the US (the destination call, which is an outgoing call), then the caller will pay a total of 28 US cents a minute. This may still be less expensive than calling directly from Spain to Australia, which is primarily why callbacks are used.
</p>, <p>Callback is often automated through the use of <a href=""/wiki/Web_callback"" title=""Web callback"">web callback</a> or mobile phone applications by companies such as <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/GlobalTel"" title=""GlobalTel"">GlobalTel</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Jajah"" title=""Jajah"">Jajah</a>, or on <a href=""/wiki/Roaming_SIM"" title=""Roaming SIM"">Roaming SIMs</a>.
</p>, <p>Many countries have banned callback services, on the grounds that they are not licensed or regulated by their governments, and deprive telephone companies in many developing countries of revenue from international calls. People who provide or use callback services have argued that these telephone companies are often state monopolies that charge unjustifiably high prices for international calls. It may also be the only way of making calls to certain countries from others, for example, <a href=""/wiki/Israel"" title=""Israel"">Israel</a> from other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Middle_Eastern"" title=""Middle Eastern"">Middle Eastern</a> countries.
</p>, <p>Other countries have sought to use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch tone dialing. However, this is also overcome by the use of speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the <a href=""/wiki/Internet"" title=""Internet"">Internet</a> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Short_message_service"" title=""Short message service"">SMS</a>.
</p>, <p>The use of callback in most developed countries has declined, owing to the liberalization of telecommunication services, which allow more direct access to low-cost international calls, without the need for a time-consuming process like callback. Also, the advent of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol"" title=""Voice over Internet Protocol"">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> services has allowed many people to make international calls via their computer connected to the Internet, although sound quality can be poorer on slower dial-up connections than on <a href=""/wiki/Broadband"" title=""Broadband"">broadband</a> ones.
</p>, <p>International callback has been credited with opening global telecom markets because it enabled competition to start up even if regulatory restrictions existed. It was popularized by a 1994 book, ""The International CallBack Book"" by Gene Retske.
</p>, <p>A <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modem</a> allows one <a href=""/wiki/Computer"" title=""Computer"">computer</a> (the client) to establish a connection to another (the server) by dialing the server's <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_number"" title=""Telephone number"">telephone number</a>.  This is sometimes viewed as being insecure because there is no <a href=""/wiki/Authentication"" title=""Authentication"">authentication</a> of the call originator.  One way to increase <a href=""/wiki/Computer_security"" title=""Computer security"">security</a> is to enforce a modem callback <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Protocol_(computing)"" title=""Protocol (computing)"">protocol</a>, which usually proceeds as a series of steps:
</p>, <p>Sometimes callback modem setups can also be used for <a href=""/wiki/Billback"" title=""Billback"">billback</a> purposes, allowing the originator to avoid lengthy toll charges.

</p>, <p>The primary regulator of telecommunications in Malaysia is the <a href=""/wiki/Malaysian_Communications_and_Multimedia_Commission"" title=""Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission"">Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission</a> (MCMC).

</p>, <p>The <a href=""/wiki/British_people"" title=""British people"">British</a>, who had a presence in Malaysia from the 18th century, were responsible for setting up the country's earliest telecommunications facilities, which over time evolved into TM. First establishing telegraph lines under the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department, telephones made their debut in the late 19th century, the earliest hand-cranked <a href=""/wiki/Magneto"" title=""Magneto"">Magneto operated devices</a> being used in <a href=""/wiki/Perak"" title=""Perak"">Perak</a> in the 1880s. The first <a href=""/wiki/Telephone_exchange"" title=""Telephone exchange"">public telephone exchange</a> in the country was also set up in <a href=""/wiki/Ipoh"" title=""Ipoh"">Ipoh</a>, in 1902.
</p>, <p>In 1891, telephones made its debut in Kuala Lumpur. At the turn of the century, a major telephony line from <a href=""/wiki/Seberang_Perai"" title=""Seberang Perai"">Province Wellesley (Seberang Prai)</a> in <a href=""/wiki/Penang"" title=""Penang"">Penang</a> to <a href=""/wiki/Johor_Bahru"" title=""Johor Bahru"">Johor Bahru</a> was built, and in 1915 the first underground cable was laid linking Ipoh, <a href=""/wiki/Taiping,_Perak"" title=""Taiping, Perak"">Taiping</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Kampar,_Perak"" title=""Kampar, Perak"">Kampar</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Teluk_Intan"" title=""Teluk Intan"">Teluk Anson</a>.
</p>, <p>Along with increased trade and the development of townships, the number of telephone subscribers in Peninsular Malaysia increased significantly. By 1930, to deal with the volume of telephony traffic, an automated magneto exchange was commissioned in <a href=""/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur"" title=""Kuala Lumpur"">Kuala Lumpur</a> on Jalan Weld. In the 1930s, all telephone exchanges in the Malayan Trunk System could communicate with exchanges in <a href=""/wiki/Java"" title=""Java"">Java</a>, the Philippines, the United States, Canada and Mexico using <a href=""/wiki/Shortwave_radio"" title=""Shortwave radio"">shortwave radio-telephone transmitters</a>. Towards the end of the decade, a Marconi Radio Terminal was installed at the Kuala Lumpur Telephone Exchange to handle overseas calls.
</p>, <p>Much of this telecommunications infrastructure was damaged during the <a href=""/wiki/World_War_II"" title=""World War II"">Second World War</a> and the <a href=""/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya"" title=""Japanese occupation of Malaya"">Japanese occupation</a>. In 1946, when the British re-established their position in Malaya, they repaired the trunk routes, restored fallen telephone poles and installed the copper wires that had either been damaged or stolen. During the Japanese occupation, the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department had been split into two separate units. When the British returned, they initially re-united the two entities, but this effort was short-lived. Along with the formation of the <a href=""/wiki/Malayan_Union"" title=""Malayan Union"">Malayan Union</a> on 1 April 1946, the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Malaysian_Telecommunications_Department"" title=""Malaysian Telecommunications Department"">Malaysian Telecommunications Department</a> and the <a href=""/wiki/Pos_Malaysia"" title=""Pos Malaysia"">Postal Services Department</a> were born, with the former controlling telegraph, telephone and wireless services and the latter overlooking mail, money orders and savings accounts.

"[<p>A <b>telecommunications tariff</b> is an open contract between a telecommunications service provider and the public, filed with a regulating body such as state and municipal <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Public_Utilities_Commission"" title=""Public Utilities Commission"">Public Utilities Commissions</a> and federal entities such as the <a href=""/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission"" title=""Federal Communications Commission"">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup>  Such tariffs outline the terms and conditions of providing telecommunications service to the public including rates, fees, and charges.  <sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-fl_2-0""><a href=""#cite_note-fl-2"">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>At a minimum, tariffs imposed must cover the cost of providing the service to the consumer. The consumer may be the final user or an intermediary such as a <a href=""/wiki/Service_provider"" title=""Service provider"">service provider</a>. If a telecommunications operator cannot recover its costs, it will make a loss and the company will go bankrupt. Tariffs must also be used to cover <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Maintenance,_repair_and_operations"" title=""Maintenance, repair and operations"">maintenance</a>, additional research and other <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Indirect_cost"" title=""Indirect cost"">indirect costs</a> associated with providing the service. However, telecommunications service providers must be careful not to over-price each service, as prices have a direct influence on demand for that service (see <a href=""/wiki/Supply_and_demand"" title=""Supply and demand"">supply and demand</a>). Such an operator must constantly balance the need to provide cheaper rates, especially if there is strong competition, with the cost of maintaining the service at an optimum quality that is acceptable to the customer. If an operator charges too much, it risks alienating its customers, resulting in a loss of traffic and therefore revenue; if they charge too little, they will have insufficient capital to maintain the network's <a href=""/wiki/Quality_of_service"" title=""Quality of service"">quality of service</a>. Over time this will result in <a href=""/wiki/Customer_attrition"" title=""Customer attrition"">customer attrition</a>.
</p>, <p>Tariffing systems vary from country to country and company to company, but in general they are based on several simple principles. Tariffs are generally made up of two components:
</p>, <p>These components form a basic tariff system but, as telecommunication advances, tariff structures become increasingly more complex.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-geek_3-0""><a href=""#cite_note-geek-3"">[3]</a></sup> Usually there is the option of calling collect (in the <a href=""/wiki/United_Kingdom"" title=""United Kingdom"">UK</a> known as <i>reversing charges</i>), where responsibility for charges normally paid by the caller is accepted by the recipient. Tariffs<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-telecomtariff_4-0""><a href=""#cite_note-telecomtariff-4"">[4]</a></sup> also depend on the bandwidth provided. For example, dial-up <a href=""/wiki/Modem"" title=""Modem"">modem</a> connections are charged at normal <a href=""/wiki/Telephone"" title=""Telephone"">telephone</a> costs, but connections such as <a href=""/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line"" title=""Digital subscriber line"">DSL</a> are usually charged using a completely different accounting system due to their <i>always on</i> nature.
</p>, <p>Increasingly, in some countries, the call charges are fixed at a monthly rate and included as a supplement to the standing charges, known as <i>inclusive calls</i>.
</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"" title=""Emergency telephone number"">Emergency calls</a> can invariably be made without charge.
</p>, <p>Most countries have a number sequence that enable the caller to make calls without charge, sometimes known as <i>free calls</i> or <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Freephone"" title=""Freephone"">freephone</a>, these are usually used by companies for their sales line (in the UK these are 0800 and 0808 numbers and in the US they are 800, 888, 877, 866, 855 and 844).
</p>, <p>Tariffs substantially in excess of the normal rate, known as <i><a href=""/wiki/Premium-rate_telephone_number"" title=""Premium-rate telephone number"">premium rate</a></i>, are used for information services, competition entries and <a href=""/wiki/Pornography"" title=""Pornography"">pornography</a> calls.
</p>, <p>These telecommunications tariffs originated with the advent of public phone service. In these times, the services provided were less complex, and customers were able to simply read the tariffs to understand how much they would be charged for each type of call.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-geek_3-1""><a href=""#cite_note-geek-3"">[3]</a></sup> Additionally, only a few telecommunication industries participated in the market, facilitating decision-making. As the market became increasingly competitive, the need for regulation decreased. In 2001, the U.S. <a href=""/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission"" title=""Federal Communications Commission"">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) declared the telecommunications market was fully competitive in the United States, and eliminated the need to file tariffs with federal regulatory agencies. However, to continue operating, many state and local governments still require telecommunications tariffs.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Call minutes are highly <a href=""/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand"" title=""Price elasticity of demand"">elastic against price</a>, this means that the demand for call minutes varies greatly according to price. A slight decrease in price leads to a great increase in call minutes. The higher the price, the more this effect is noticeable, for both business and residential customers on international or local calls. This means that it is often the case that more revenue is achievable at lower prices, that is, E &lt; -1.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-van_6-0""><a href=""#cite_note-van-6"">[6]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Internet traffic research show that the traffic intensity is directly affected by the tariffs charged in connecting customers to their <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Internet_Service_Provider"" title=""Internet Service Provider"">Internet Service Provider</a> (ISP).<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-van_6-1""><a href=""#cite_note-van-6"">[6]</a></sup> For example,  a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Circuit-switched_network"" title=""Circuit-switched network"">circuit-switched network</a> provider charges different tariffs at different times of the day. It was noted that at the time that the rates decreased, the traffic intensity logged by the ISP increased dramatically and then decayed over time at an exponential rate. The conclusion of the research was that by varying prices over time, a telecommunications service provider can reduce the level of the traffic intensity at peak periods, resulting in lower equipment costs because of the reduced need to provision to meet peak demand, which in turn leads to increases in long-term revenue and profitability. <i>See <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Time-based_pricing"" title=""Time-based pricing"">Time-based pricing</a></i>.

In the rural areas, the telephone services are still outdated, inadequate, and low density.
</p>, <p>The Tsarist government of Russia issued its first decree on the development of urban telephone networks in 1881 and, as already discussed, the first exchanges in the Empire opened the following year.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> Initially, telephone exchanges were granted to private developers as concessions in the major cities, but in 1884 the government began to construct the first of its own exchanges and subsequently suspended the award of new concessions. Intercity telephone communications grew very slowly, with only a dozen lines in place by the start of the 20th century, most serving <a href=""/wiki/Moscow"" title=""Moscow"">Moscow</a>-<a href=""/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"" title=""Saint Petersburg"">Saint Petersburg</a> traffic. After 1900, when the initial concessions had expired, the government eased control over private concessionaires and a burst of new construction took place. Included in the expansion during this period was the slow growth of exchanges built and operated by rural <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Zemstva"" title=""Zemstva"">Zemstva</a></i>, which were treated essentially as private concessionaires by the Imperial government.
</p>, <p>Telephones played a significant role during the upheavals of 1917. In February, according to the last tsarist Chief of Police, 'neither the military authorities nor the mutineers thought of occupying the Telephone Exchange'; consequently it continued to function, serving both sides, until the operators finally left their
positions amidst the growing confusion.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-10""><a href=""#cite_note-10"">[10]</a></sup> In early July, however, the Provisional Government, fearing a Bolshevik coup, reportedly ordered the central telephone exchange to boycott calls requested by Bolsheviks (automatic switching systems had not yet been introduced).
</p>, <p>In 1918, when the Soviet government moved to Moscow and war conditions were producing extreme shortages, <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Sovnarkom"" title=""Sovnarkom"">Sovnarkom</a> ordered a reduction of 50% in the volume of telephone communications in the new capital, to ensure that official needs of the new government would be served. The primary consequence of this decree for individuals was the 'communalisation' of telephones in private houses and flats. According to the decree, restrictions were focused on the 'parasitic stratum' of society, in the interest of the 'working population'. With the exception of personal phones belonging to high government officials, doctors and midwives, telephones in private flats were placed at the disposal of 'house committees', to be made available for 'general use' free of charge. Houses without telephones were entitled to free use of the communal phone of a neighbouring house; the decree further ordered the immediate installation of at least 150 telephones in public squares, particularly in outlying regions.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11"">[11]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>One year later Sovnarkom <a href=""/wiki/Nationalization"" title=""Nationalization"">nationalized</a> all telephone systems in the Russian Republic-including all intercity, urban, concessionary and zemstvo exchangesand assigned their administration and operation to the <a href=""/wiki/People%27s_Commissariat_for_Posts_and_Telegraphs_of_the_RSFSR"" title=""People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR"">People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR</a>. Beginning with the nationalization of telephones in 1919, Soviet policy exhibited two main characteristics: telephones increasingly became instruments for the bureaucracy and bureaucrats, and telephones in general were accorded a low investment priority. In March 1920, for instance, government institutions were exempted from the telephone tariff, receiving the right to use the telephone without payment, albeit for sharply restricted periods.
</p>, <p>Until the end of 1991 (the end of the USSR), the sole fixed-line telephone operator in the country was the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Ministry_of_Communications_of_the_USSR"" title=""Ministry of Communications of the USSR"">Ministry of Communications of the USSR</a>. The state possessed all telecommunications structure and access networks. In 1994, the investment communication company (OJSC “Sviazinvest”) was established by the <a href=""/wiki/Decree_of_the_President_of_Russia"" title=""Decree of the President of Russia"">Presidential Decree</a> No.1989 dated 10 October 1994 “<i>On the specific features of the state management of the electric communication network for public use in Russian Federation</i>”. The authorised capital of OJSC “Sviazinvest” was formed by the consolidation of federal shares of joint stock companies acting in the area of electric communications and established during the privatisation of the state enterprises for electric communications. The seven regional incumbents which make up Svyazinvest, majority-owned by the government, in early 2011 merged with the key subsidiary Rostelecom. The move created an integrated company based on Rostelecom which will be better placed to exploit economies of scale in coming years.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lteportal2011_12-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lteportal2011-12"">[12]</a></sup>

</p>, <p>Liberalization of the long-distance communication market is another market driver.

</p>, <p>The substitution of long-distance fixed-line voice services by mobile and IP traffic sped up after 2008, when mobile operators shifted to the fixed-line segment (Vimpelcom was the first company out of the Big 3 to acquire <a href=""/wiki/Golden_Telecom"" title=""Golden Telecom"">Golden Telecom</a> in early 2008) and simultaneously increased investments into own trunk network infrastructure to support rapid 3G traffic growth.

</p>, <p>Russian regulation stipulates that new players must build their own networks. The growth of traffic between Europe and Asia is an additional opportunity; more than 6,000 km of international communication cables were built during the first nine months of 2007, representing a 48.5% increase on 2006, according to the Russian Ministry of Communication and Mass Media.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-15""><a href=""#cite_note-15"">[15]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Tariffs in the fixed-line segment are determined by the Federal Tariff Service on an annual basis, taking into consideration inflation and the operators' expenses. The price competition in the long-distance segment increased as mobile operators began implementing promotional tariffs to stimulate voice traffic growth after the crisis (long-distance traffic is predominantly built by corporate clients). At the same time, traditional operators had limited room for maneuver as intra-zonal and domestic LD tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the government, remained flat over the last three years. As a result, mobile operators managed to bite off a heavy share of intraregional and long-distance market from traditional fixed-line operators, first of all regional operators of Svyazinvest, which are now united under Rostelecom.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-16""><a href=""#cite_note-16"">[16]</a></sup>

This option is shown by the dotted line for the COII1. Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) is served by the nearest CO. All TEs are forming the meshed network. Up to the 1990s, TE was independent element of the local network. Operators did not use the equipment combined functions Tandem and Toll Exchanges. So, TE provided connections between COs of the local network, and access to the toll exchange. A function of the toll exchange is to establish connections for the long-distance and international calls. Last type of calls is served by the Gateway (GW). Processing of the local calls is performed by the COs and TEs. If a subscriber dials digit ""8"" (prefix of the long-distance connection in the national PSTN) all further processing of the call is a function of a toll exchange.

"[<p><b>Transposition</b> is the periodic swapping of positions of the conductors of a <a href=""/wiki/Transmission_line"" title=""Transmission line"">transmission line</a>, in order to reduce <a href=""/wiki/Crosstalk"" title=""Crosstalk"">crosstalk</a> and otherwise improve transmission.  In telecommunications this applies to <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Balanced_pair"" title=""Balanced pair"">balanced pairs</a> whilst in <a href=""/wiki/Power_transmission"" title=""Power transmission"">power transmission</a> lines three conductors are periodically transposed.
</p>, <p>For cables, the swapping is gradual and continuous; that is the two or three conductors are twisted around each other.  For communication cables, this is called <a href=""/wiki/Twisted_pair"" title=""Twisted pair"">twisted pair</a>.  For <a href=""/wiki/Overhead_power_line"" title=""Overhead power line"">overhead power lines</a> or open pair communication lines, the conductors are exchanged at pylons, for example at <a href=""/wiki/Transposition_tower"" title=""Transposition tower"">transposition towers</a> or at <a href=""/wiki/Utility_pole"" title=""Utility pole"">utility poles</a>, respectively.
</p>, <p>The mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposition.  Transposition also equalizes their impedance relative to the ground, thus avoiding one-sided loads in <a href=""/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power"" title=""Three-phase electric power"">three-phase electric power</a> systems.  Transposing is an effective measure for the reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.
</p>, <p>For longer powerlines without branches, wires are transposed according to the transposing scheme.  At closely branched grids and where several electric circuits share a route (in particular when the lines operate at different voltages) on the same pylons the outside unbalance of the line, which is caused by the other electric circuits, dominates.  In these cases, one finds large deviations from the transposing schemes.  For example, in some such transpositions, only two of the three conductors on the pylons change their place. Also, transpositions on pylons near power substations are used to get an optimal arrangement of the feeding system without crossing of conductors. 
</p>, <p>As the mutual influence of electric circuits can change after new lines are installed or old lines dismantled, certain transpositions may disappear or be added after new construction in electricity mains. In the case of a twisted line the individual conductors of an electric circuit swap places, either in their whole course (at cables) or at certain points (at overhead lines). The mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposing. The unbalance of the line, which can lead to one-sided loads in three-phase systems, is also reduced. Transposing of overhead lines is usually realized at so-called transposing pylons. Transposing is an effective measure for the reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.
</p>, <p>A <b>transposing scheme</b> is a pattern by which the conductors of <a href=""/wiki/Overhead_power_line"" title=""Overhead power line"">overhead power lines</a> are transposed at transposing structures. To ensure balanced capacitance of a three-phase line, each of the three conductors must hang once at each position of the overhead line.
</p>, <p>At a <a href=""/wiki/Transposition_tower"" title=""Transposition tower"">transposition tower</a>, the conductors change their relative places in the line. A transposing structure may be a standard structure with special cross arms or maybe a dead-end structure. The transposing is necessary as there is capacitance between conductors, as well as between conductors and ground. This is typically not symmetrical across phases. By transposing, the overall capacitance for the whole line is approximately balanced.  Transposing also reduce effects to communication circuits.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""><a href=""#cite_note-1"">[1]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>Modern power lines are normally not transposed on the go as the difference in the inductance of the phases are negligibly small due to asymmetrical spacing, However, intermediate switching stations, where the transposition takes place, are implemented whenever it necessary and can not be neglected. <sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In communication cables, the transposition is used to reduce coupling between circuits in the same cable. The principal measure is the pitch or lay length,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> the distance over which the pairs of a circuit are twisted.  By twisting, the wires become longer than the cable. The stranding factor indicates the relationship of single wire length to cable length; it amounts to with communication cables about 1.02 to 1.04.
</p>, <p>In practice the following kinds of stranding occur more frequently: 
</p>, <p>The kinds of stranding have different transmission characteristics. The capacity of a stranding affects itself, for example, the two conductors of a quadruple run parallel over the entire cable length in <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Star_quad"" title=""Star quad"">star quad</a> twisting. <a href=""/wiki/Capacitance"" title=""Capacitance"">Capacitance</a> between the conductors is thus substantially higher than with Dieselhorst Martin (DHM) - stranding in which the situation of the conductors to each other in the cable changes repeatedly. Because of the smaller work capacity of the DHM stranding, it is possible to form additional electric circuits with the help of a <a href=""/wiki/Phantom_circuit"" title=""Phantom circuit"">phantom circuit</a>.

</p>, <p>In July 2003 the government introduced a <i>Deregulation Policy for the Telecommunication Sector</i>,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> which allowed and encouraged foreign companies to invest in the Pakistani telecommunications market.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-TLIP_1-1""><a href=""#cite_note-TLIP-1"">[1]</a></sup> The centerpiece of the deregulation was the establishment of two categories of basic services licenses: Local loop (LL), for fixed line telecommunication within the 14 PTCL regions, and Long-distance and International (LDI), for connectivity between regions.” Two sets of criteria set by the regulatory authorities must be met before an operator is allowed to start operation: one for the issuance of a <a href=""/wiki/License"" title=""License"">license</a> and another for the maintenance of <a href=""/wiki/Service_quality"" title=""Service quality"">service quality</a>.
</p>, <p>In 2006, Etisalat International Pakistan, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href=""/wiki/Etisalat"" title=""Etisalat"">Emirates Telecommunications Corporation</a>, purchased a 26% stake in PTCL and assumed management control of the company.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>In 2008 Pakistan was the world's third-fastest growing telecommunications market. Pakistan's telecom infrastructure is improving dramatically with foreign and domestic investments into fixed-line and mobile networks; fiber systems are being constructed throughout the country to aid in network growth.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lirneasia_tre_5-0""><a href=""#cite_note-lirneasia_tre-5"">[5]</a></sup> The major growth in mobile telephony was triggered by two steps taken by Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman FRS when he was Federal Minister of Science &amp; technology. These were to introduce a ""Calling Party Pays"" (CPP) regime under which no charges are paid by the call receiving party on mobile phone calls. The second was the launching of UFone as a government owned mobile phone company that competitive call rates that led to strong market competition. The impact of these two measures has been the expansion of mobile telephony from 0.3 million mobile phones in 2001, to 160 million mobile phones by 2018.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup>

</p>, <p><a href=""/wiki/LIRNEasia"" title=""LIRNEasia"">LIRNEasia</a>'s Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index summarizes stakeholders’ perception of the regulatory and policy environment and provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Pakistan. The tool measured seven dimensions: (i) market entry; (ii) access to scarce resources; (iii) interconnection; (iv) tariff regulation; (v) anti-competitive practices; (vi) universal services; and (vii) quality of service; for the fixed, mobile, and broadband sectors.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lirneasia_tre_5-1""><a href=""#cite_note-lirneasia_tre-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>, <p>The survey found that in Pakistan the <a href=""/wiki/Mobile_network_operator"" title=""Mobile network operator"">mobile sector</a> was most active, followed by broadband; while the <a href=""/wiki/Landline"" title=""Landline"">fixed-line</a> sector remained somewhat static. The parameters that improved compared to the 2006 survey were: <a href=""/wiki/Interconnection"" title=""Interconnection"">interconnection</a>, tariff regulation, regulation of anti-competitive practices, and <a href=""/wiki/Universal_service"" title=""Universal service"">universal service obligation</a> in the mobile sector; and market entry, interconnection, regulation of anti-competitive practices and universal service obligation in the fixed sector. <a href=""/wiki/Market_entry_strategy"" title=""Market entry strategy"">Market entry</a> received a low score in the mobile sector due to the perception that the cost of a new or renewal mobile license was prohibitive, thus posing a serious barrier to entry. However, this conclusion may have been incorrect, as the license fee, at least in the case of renewal by Mobilink GSM, was paid in installments over a period of three years. Thus, lack of complete information on the part of survey participants may have skewed the results.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-lirneasia_tre_5-2""><a href=""#cite_note-lirneasia_tre-5"">[5]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup>

Following the creation of a separate regulatory entity, market segments were opened to competition, starting with mobile services in 1995. The international services market, considered the most lucrative, was opened to other providers in 2000.
</p>, <p>At the beginning of 2013, S-Fone and Beeline services are temporarily shut down due to hard competitions with other mobile operators.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[9]</a></sup> Beeline, a mobile operator found by Global Telecommunications Corporation or G-Tel and VimpelCom came to the market in 2009.

The programming is relayed nationwide via a network of provincial and municipal TV stations.  Vietnam law limits access to satellite TV, but many households are able to access foreign programming via home satellite equipment.
</p>, <p>Although basic Internet services had existed in Vietnam since the early nineties, the first commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP) opened for business in 1997. Since 1997 Vietnam has been connected by two gateways: one in Hanoi which connects with <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Australia"" title=""Australia"">Australia</a>, and the other in Ho Chi Minh City, which connects with the <a href=""/wiki/United_States"" title=""United States"">United States</a> by <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Sprint_Nextel_Corporation"" title=""Sprint Nextel Corporation"">Sprint</a>.

"[<p>A <b>telecommunications pedestal</b> is a ground-level housing for a passive connection point for underground cables. Technicians require access to connection points.

Pedestals are used for <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/CATV"" title=""CATV"">CATV</a> (known as a <a href=""/wiki/Cable_box_(outside)"" title=""Cable box (outside)"">cable box</a> in such a situation), <a href=""/wiki/Telephone"" title=""Telephone"">telephone</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Passive_optical_network"" title=""Passive optical network"">passive optical networks</a>, and other <a href=""/wiki/Telecommunications"" title=""Telecommunications"">telecommunications</a> systems.
</p>, <p>A pedestal is generally a sheet metal or plastic housing that encloses a <a href=""/wiki/Electrical_termination"" title=""Electrical termination"">passive termination</a> block. The pedestal is usually about 3 feet high and has a diameter of less than one foot, with a circular, rectangular, oval, or ""rounded rectangle"" cross-section. The pedestal either has an access panel or removable housing. One, two, three or (occasionally) more underground distribution cables rise from the ground into the bottom of the pedestal and the individual circuits from the cables are terminated on the termination block. In addition to distribution cables, the pedestal may terminate one or more individual underground subscriber cables. The cables are cross-connected as needed at the termination block.
